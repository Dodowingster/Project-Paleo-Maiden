## Profile/Background

Kitadani Fukui is an intense, honorable, and deeply disciplined Paleo Maiden. While not officially affiliated with a specific league's philosophy (she considers herself a student of the **Bushidō** tradition).

Her life is dedicated to the pursuit of the **Flawless Draw**—a single, instantaneous strike that ends the fight decisively and cleanly. She is not a cold fighter, but her extreme focus on **P-Magic Purity** often makes her appear cold and intimidating to those around her, as she radiates an aura of unwavering resolve. Her true goal is to prove that **mastery and honor** always surpass brute force and luck.

However, due to her obssessiveness towards the purity of her own P-Magic concentration, she often has a strong distaste towards negative associted things such as curse words or
anything that she believes would taint her P-Magic- leading to her being overly protective towards her P-Magic hygiene and takes extreme measures to keep it "pure".

## Trivia

* Her fighting animations feature a scattering of **Sakura petals**, symbolizing the **brief, beautiful, and decisive nature** of her *Iai* draw (a classic Bushidō metaphor).
* Her physical appearance and attire are designed to make her look like a standard, agile **Katana master** (Dromaeosaurid), but her immensely powerful and deliberate attacks surprise rivals with the **cleaving force of a Megaraptoran/Nōdachi**.
* The ritual of purifying her P-Magic after a fight is done with a traditional **Japanese breathing exercise** (Kokyū-hō) that focuses her energy flow.
* Her birthdate (May 13th) is a direct numerical reference to the year of her discovery in the **Kitadani Formation (1994)**. The number 13 is derived from summing the last two digits of the year ($9+4=13$). The month (May) is chosen to symbolize the **traditional Spring season** associated with the delicate yet powerful Sakura motif.
