Board Game Deets:
starting point - uni
fixed map - non linear movement
not really a loop, but there will be ways to go back to uni

24 turns in one year/round
each turn
	roll dice
	choose path but must go based on number rolled
	land on a space
		- fight space
		- event space
		- rest space (checkpoint)
			- respawn here and -1 turn on faint
			- health value restored to full?


what is constant:
- map
- turn count (let player set this? but have a standard)
- year count
- starting decks for each char


what can players choose
- starting char
- path taken
- shop items
- card selected
- camping
	- limited number, replenished after finishing a loop
	- health value restored discuss later


what is rng
- card selection
- card battling
- dice roll
- map spaces (rng with rules)
- current turn's event
	- sparring sessions (zako/mob fight)
	- shop
	- rest
	- rival
	- random event


Card Game Deets:
maximum cards in a deck is 15 (subject to change)
starting deck: 9 cards 
Each cards cost Mana
Amount of Mana is determined by your mana guage
initial cards (red as example):
- atk - 3 dmg x3
- def - block 2 dmg x3
- class specific cards
	- power up - +1 power this turn x1
	- damage over time - enemy takes 1 dmg every turn x1
	- hit harder - 5 dmg x1

who moves first?
- determine using dice roll - for every turn instead of only turn 1
- larger dice roll means you go first (roll 6, oppoent roll 5, you go first)
- value of dice face can change base on events on board [not final]
- can increase or decrease dice face (6 on dice becomes 7, 6 on dice becomes 5) [not final]

- general algo for AI - both player and enemy:
	- largest mana cost card always go first 
	- prioritizes by color number
	- generics are lowest priority


- run simulation until one dies

Strategy(future)
-different strategy you can choose before a battle
-depend on what strategy you choose, different cards will be prioritized to be played 

- what type of fun (IMPORTANT):
	1) support your fav chars (like uma musume/tamagotchi)
	2) gambling
	3) satisfaction from things working out - combos
	
-Tournament Related
	- Tournaments serves as the Rival Arc which explores each Paleo-Maidens individually which is the main story highlight
	- During the deck building (world map & exploration), each potential rivals will be introduced in event spaces at random
	- In the tournamnent, players will be available to enlist their paleo-maiden inside the bracket among the 4 main rivals (subject to change)
	but the bracket seed is completely random so each run does not guarantee story events. This is to ensure players that multiple playthrough for a single paleo-Maiden
	is required to experience the full character arc/story

-Combat Log
	- Nice to have combat log that reports what is going on during combat
	- The combat log should be written and flavoured as if its from a commentator narrating the fight
	- Potentially, we can also use Fighting game terms for fun and making the game easy to be disucssed among players later in the future.
