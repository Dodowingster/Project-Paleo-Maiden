Board Game Deets:
starting point - uni
fixed map - non linear movement
not really a loop, but there will be ways to go back to uni

24 turns in one year/round
each turn
	roll dice
	choose path but must go based on number rolled
	land on a space
		- fight space
		- event space


what is constant:
- map
- turn count (let player set this? but have a standard)
- year count
- starting decks for each char

Card Game Deets:
maximum cards in a deck is 15 (subject to change)
starting deck: 9 cards 
initial cards (red as example):
- atk - 3 dmg x3
- def - block 2 dmg x3
- class specific cards
	- power up - +1 power this turn x1
	- damage over time - enemy takes 1 dmg every turn x1
	- hit harder - 5 dmg x1

who moves first?
- determine using dice roll - for every turn instead of only turn 1

- general algo for AI - both player and enemy:
	- prioritizes by color number
	- generics are lowest priority

- run simulation until one dies



- what type of fun (IMPORTANT):
	1) support your fav chars (like uma musume/tamagotchi)
	2) gambling
	3) satisfaction from things working out - combos
