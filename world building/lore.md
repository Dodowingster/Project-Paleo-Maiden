## The Paleo Maidens

### Origins

The Paleo Maidens are living $\text{Deinos}$ Manifestations, an ancient, primal energy forged at the dawn of time. Their existence is a miracle of genetic regression; they can emerge unpredictably as offspring from any human pairing, or they may be born through a union between a human and a Maiden
 
### Characteristics and Lifestyle

A defining characteristic of a Paleo Maiden is the powerful, primal instinct that courses through them—a strong desire to fight, compete, and test their strength. However, this instinct does not dictate their destiny. While many are drawn to the glory of the competitive leagues, it is just as common for Maidens to channel their unique drive into other pursuits. They integrate fully into society, becoming scientists, artists, doctors, and leaders, contributing to the world in countless ways that have nothing to do with combat. For these Maidens, their inner fire becomes a source of passion and ambition in their chosen careers.

### Lifespan
 
Due to the primal energy that defines their existence, Paleo Maidens possess a greatly extended lifespan, capable of living for several centuries. They age normally through childhood and adolescence, but upon reaching physical maturity—typically in their early twenties—the aging process slows dramatically. For the remainder of their long lives, they maintain the appearance of being in their physical prime.
 
This longevity has profound social and psychological effects. A Maiden will outlive her human parents, friends, and potentially even her own human-born children, leading to a unique and sometimes solitary perspective on the world. This extended life gives them ample time to master their abilities, but it also carries the weight of accumulated loss and memory, a burden that institutions like Stratum help them learn to manage. While they are not immortal, their natural lifespan far exceeds that of a normal human.

### Family Clades

Beyond direct lineage, Maidens are categorized into broader **Family Clades** based on shared paleontological ancestry. These groupings, like the **Abelisauridae** or **Dromaeosauridae**, are not based on immediate family ties but on deep, instinctual connections. This shared ancestry can foster camaraderie or, just as often, intense rivalries between different branches of the same ancient family tree. The broadest of these divisions are the two great orders: the **Ornithischian** and **Saurischian** clades, which form the foundational divide in Paleo Maiden society.

### Lineage and Legacy Naming

A Paleo Maiden's name is a direct reflection of her identity, lineage, and generational status. While each Maiden is the unique, active representative of her species for her generation, the mantle can be passed down, creating powerful dynasties with names that echo through history. This legacy naming system applies specifically to lineages where both mother and daughter are Paleo Maidens. It does not apply if a Maiden is born to a human mother, who would retain her own name.

*   **Active Maiden (Current Generation):** The name is derived from her scientific classification: `[Species Name] [Genus Name]`.
    *   *Example:* The current *Carnotaurus sastrei* Maiden is **Sastrei Taurus**.

*   **Direct Predecessor (Mother):** Upon retirement, the previous generation's Maiden adopts an honorific title using her **Family Clade**: `[Family Name] [Genus Name]`.
    *   *Example:* Sastrei's mother, the previous *Carnotaurus*, is known as **Abeli Taurus**, named for the **Abelisauridae** family. This title signifies her status as a respected elder of her clan.

*   **Ancestral Lineage (Grandmothers & Beyond):** The names of even earlier ancestors ascend the paleontological hierarchy, using the names of larger and more ancient clades. This creates a legendary lineage that stretches back through time.
    *   *Grandmother:* **Cerato Taurus** (from the *Ceratosauria* infraorder).
    *   *Great-Grandmother:* **Thero Taurus** (from the *Theropoda* suborder).
    *   *Progenitor:* **Sauris Taurus** (from the *Saurischia* order).

This system establishes a clear hierarchy of legacy, where an ancestor's name reflects their historical significance and how foundational they were to their entire lineage.

### Paleo-Magic (P-Magic)

Paleo-Magic (P-Magic) is the manifestation of a Maiden's primal energy and serves as their direct **Health Pool** in combat. This system is what allows for high-stakes competition without the risk of fatal injury. Attacks deplete an opponent's P-Magic reserve rather than causing physical harm. A Maiden is defeated when her P-Magic reaches zero, resulting in a state of complete exhaustion that may cause her to lose focus or faint. Since every Maiden is born with a different P-Magic capacity, their innate durability and combat style can vary significantly.

While these attacks do not cause lasting physical injuries like cuts or broken bones, their impact is intensely real. P-Magic operates by directly interfacing with an opponent's life force, tricking their nervous system into simulating the effects of a physical blow. A strike from a P-Magic-conjured greatsword, for example, delivers not only a concussive jolt of energy but also inflicts the pure, agonizing *sensation* of a deep wound by directly stimulating the target's pain receptors. This neurological assault is what depletes P-Magic. The pain is real, the disorientation is real, but the physical body remains unharmed. It is the magical equivalent of taking a heavy body blow, felt throughout one's entire being, and it is this sensory overload that ultimately leads to exhaustion and defeat.

 ### Paleo Arts and Magic Discplines

**Paleo Arts** are the unique, innate fighting styles that every Maiden possesses, a direct reflection of their species' primal instincts and physical attributes. These arts dictate how a Maiden moves, fights, and conjures her P-Magic into weapons and abilities. Mastering one's Paleo Art is the lifelong journey of every competitive Maiden.

This mastery is achieved by channeling P-Magic through one of three core **Magic Disciplines**. While a Maiden can learn techniques from any discipline, she is born with a natural affinity for one, which defines her core philosophy in combat.

*   **The Discipline of Power (Red):** Fueled by raw emotion and overwhelming instinct, Red P-Magic is explosive and direct. Maidens with an affinity of Power, like **Tyran Rex**, focus on pure offensive force. They use their P-Magic to enhance their physical strength, break through defenses, and unleash devastating signature moves that can end a fight in a single, decisive clash. Their style is about imposing their will on the battlefield.

*   **The Discipline of Focus (Blue):** Rooted in mental clarity, patience, and absolute precision, Blue P-Magic is the discipline of the perfectionist. Maidens with an affinity for Focus, like **Kitadani Fukui**, treat combat as a meditative art. They channel their P-Magic with flawless control, using it for defensive stances, parries, and devastatingly powerful counter-attacks that punish the slightest mistake. Their style is a chess match where every move is deliberate, waiting for the single, perfect moment to deliver a checkmate strike.

*   **The Discipline of Flow (Green):** Centered on agility, speed, and momentum, Green P-Magic is fluid and relentless. Maidens with a Green affinity, like **Sastrei Taurus**, use their energy to enhance their movement, evade attacks, and overwhelm opponents with a rapid succession of precise strikes. Their style is about maintaining a constant tempo and never giving the enemy a moment to rest.

*   **The Discipline of Control (Yellow):** Embodying resilience, stamina, and tactical positioning, Yellow P-Magic is the discipline of the unbreachable fortress. Maidens with an affinity for Control, like **Horri Tricera**, excel at battlefield manipulation and attrition. They channel their P-Magic to conjure powerful shields, reinforce their own defenses to an unparalleled degree, and create zones that restrict enemy movement. Their style is not about landing a single perfect blow, but about outlasting their opponents, weathering every storm, and winning through sheer, unbreakable endurance.

The interplay between these disciplines forms the foundation of Paleo Maiden combat, creating a complex dynamic where no single style is inherently superior. True masters, through rigorous training and self-discovery, can evolve their vocation by fusing their primary discipline with aspects of another, creating powerful and unpredictable hybrid fighting styles.

## Origin of the Stratum Institute, University of Paleo Maidens

### Founding and Philosophy

**Dr. Owen** (*An homage to [Sir Richard Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owen)*) is the founder of the **Stratum Insitute**, a university housing multiple Paleo Maidens to help them train and hone their skills as Paleo Champions. Dr. Owen discovered that the Paleo Maidens have an innate instinct to fight resulting in his inscription that classify these Paleo Maidens as **δεινό**: *One's terror is the root of everyone's fear*, it is named as the Owen Inscription.

However, **Dr. Gideon** (*An homage to [Dr. Gideon Mantell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_Mantell)*) sees the Paleo Maidens' innate instinct for combat as something to be inspired about. He was inspired after seeing a **Ornistishian Family** origin-Paleo Maiden, whom protected him from thugs- to which he proposed for the Paleo Maidens to inspire others and allow them to influence others with their prowess and special abilities. He would then propose the University to have the **Herbi Dorm**, initially dormitories for all Paleo Maidens. Dr Gideon later reinterpreted the Owen Inscription of **Deinos** as "**δεινό**. *One's terror is the root of everyone's awe*" 

### Structure and Curriculum

It was then discovered that, some Paleo Maidens have a higher tendency to spar and is quite rowdy compared to others, hence **Professor Buckland** (*An homage to [Prof. William Buckland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Buckland)*) proposed for a secondary dorm, the **Carni Dorm** to seperate them and control the chaotic nature of Paleo Maidens when bundled together.

With the Institute's foundation established, it was **Anning** (*An homage to [Mary Anning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Anning)*) who championed the hiring of a formal faculty of lecturers. Having been a brilliant, self-taught paleontologist who was often excluded by the academic elite of her time, she argued passionately that the Paleo Maidens needed more than just combat training. She insisted on a full university curriculum, believing that true strength came from understanding oneself and the world. It was her belief that with a proper education in science, history, and philosophy, the Maidens could become true leaders and authors of their own destiny, not just powerful tools to be wielded by others. Her advocacy led to the robust academic program that defines the Stratum Institute today.

The academic year is divided into two distinct six-month periods to balance practical experience with academic and mental preparation:

*   **The Preparatory Campus Semester (First 6 Months):** A Maiden's journey begins with an intensive on-campus period of study and planning. In game terms, this is the 'home screen' or hub where the player manages their Maiden, reviews their collection, and prepares for the long journey ahead.

*   **The Great Expedition (3 Years):** This is the "world tour" itself—the core gameplay run where Maidens and their lecturers travel across the Primeval Continents for three consecutive years. Each year is represented by a 24-turn journey on the game board, culminating in an end-of-year league championship (Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous).

*   **The Post-Expedition Campus Semester (Final 6 Months):** After completing the three-year expedition, Maidens return to the institute for a final semester of reflection, advanced studies, and preparation for their professional careers in the Apex or Bulwark leagues.

## The Paleo Maiden Union and the Paleo World Championship

As Paleo Maidens became more integrated into society, the need for a global governing body became apparent. Thus, the **Paleo Maiden Union (PMU)** was established. The PMU serves as the international organization responsible for sanctioning official competitions, managing Maiden registrations, and establishing the rules of engagement for public sparring and championship events. Its primary charter, heavily influenced by Dr. Gideon's philosophy, is to promote Paleo Maidens as figures of inspiration and to provide a safe, structured outlet for their competitive instincts.

### The Paleo World Championship (World Cup)

The pinnacle of the university circuit is the **The Paleo World Championship (World Cup)**, the final tournament held at the end of the third-year **Cretaceous League**. Winning this event is the ultimate goal for any student at the Stratum Institute. The path to this championship is a grueling three-year journey through escalating annual leagues, each serving as a qualifier for the next:

*   **Year 1: The Triassic League (World Cup Qualifiers)**
*   **Year 2: The Jurassic League (World Cup Semi-Finals)**
*   **Year 3: The Cretaceous League (World Cup Grand Finals)**

These championships are far more than academic qualifiers; they are global cultural phenomena. The general public celebrates competing Paleo Maidens as world-renowned athletes, with millions of fans passionately supporting their favorite champions. The tournaments are broadcast live across the globe with insane production value, combining the prestige of the Olympics with the passionate, high-stakes rivalries of professional sports. This public adoration turns successful Maidens into household names and inspirational figures for a generation.

### Different Leagues for Different Maidens

While the World Cup is the pinnacle of university-level achievement, true global recognition is earned in the professional circuits. After graduating, a champion's path is defined by which of the two most prestigious pro leagues she chooses to enter. This decision is deeply personal, driven by the Maiden's innate discipline, personal philosophy, and ultimate goals.

*   **The Apex League:** This professional league is the premier stage for decisive, spectacular combat. It champions the philosophies of ending a fight with overwhelming force or a single, perfect strike. As such, it is the natural home for Maidens of the **Power (Red)** and **Focus (Blue)** disciplines.

*   **The Bulwark League:** In contrast, this league celebrates endurance, strategy, and relentless pressure. It is the ideal circuit for Maidens who master the disciplines of **Flow (Green)** and **Control (Yellow)**, excelling in battles of attrition and tactical maneuvering.

Winning the championship of both the Apex and Bulwark leagues in the same post-graduate year is a legendary feat known as the "Professional Crown," cementing a Maiden's status as an all-time great.

However, some Maidens choose to defy expectations. A Maiden like **Sastrei Taurus**, despite her natural affinity for the **Flow (Green)** discipline, might choose to enter the **Apex League**. For her, it is the ultimate challenge: to prove that her philosophy of speed and technique can triumph in the very arena dedicated to raw power, turning her journey into a rebellious quest for validation.

## The World

The geography of this world is one of profound duality, with a planet roughly twice the size of the one known to history. It is divided between two distinct realms: the familiar nations of the Modern World and the ancient, untamed Primeval Continents.

### The Modern World

The Modern World is where the vast majority of humanity resides, in nations and cities that mirror our own. It is a world of familiar technology, culture, and civilization. Most Paleo Maidens are born into this world, their extraordinary abilities first emerging within its familiar cities and towns. They grow up as part of modern society before their unique calling leads them toward their training.

### The Primeval Continents

Completely separate from the modern landmasses, the Primeval Continents—[Pangea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea), [Laurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasia), and [Gondwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana)—are vast, primordial landscapes where prehistoric flora still flourish. These wild continents are naturally preserved and meticulously maintained by the **Paleo Maiden Union (PMU)**, which has designated them as **sacred training grounds**.

To support the rigorous training regimens, the PMU has established multiple temporary accommodations across these lands, allowing Maidens to rest and recover as they learn to unleash their full power. It is on these proving grounds that they truly connect with their primal origins.

## Role of the Player

The player takes on the role of a **Lecturer** at the Stratum Institute, selecting a Paleo Maiden Champion (e.g., Tyran Rex, Sastrei Taurus) to mentor. The three-year training program is structured as a **world tour**, where the lecturer and their Maiden travel across the vast and dangerous Primeval Continents. This journey serves as a rigorous, hands-on curriculum to prepare them for the ultimate prize: the Paleo-Maiden Championship.

For those who achieve victory in the World Cup, an even greater challenge awaits: the player guides their graduated champion into one of the elite professional leagues—either the **Apex League** or the **Bulwark League**, depending on the Maiden's personal quest—to aim for the ultimate "Professional Crown."

While managing their Champion's training schedule and travel itinerary, players are not alone. The institute's faculty is staffed by renowned paleontologist-professors—the very individuals who, in our world, discovered the fossils of the dinosaurs their Maidens are based on. For example, **Dr. Bonaparte** (*An homage based on [Dr. José Bonaparte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Bonaparte)*) is the world's leading expert on Maidens like *Sastrei Taurus* and *Caza Amarga*. As a lecturer, players can consult these professors for invaluable insights into a Maiden's unique strengths and latent potential, helping them tailor their coaching for maximum efficiency. These professors, often rivals in their own academic fields, provide a rich source of guidance and competitive drama within the university.
