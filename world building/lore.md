## The Paleo Maidens

### Origins

The Paleo Maidens are living $\text{Deinos}$ Manifestations, an ancient, primal energy forged at the dawn of time. Their existence is a miracle of genetic regression; they can emerge unpredictably as offspring from any human pairing, or they may be born through a union between a human and a Maiden
 
### Characteristics and Lifestyle

A defining characteristic of a Paleo Maiden is the powerful, primal instinct that courses through them—a strong desire to fight, compete, and test their strength. However, this instinct does not dictate their destiny. While many are drawn to the glory of the competitive leagues, it is just as common for Maidens to channel their unique drive into other pursuits. They integrate fully into society, becoming scientists, artists, doctors, and leaders, contributing to the world in countless ways that have nothing to do with combat. For these Maidens, their inner fire becomes a source of passion and ambition in their chosen careers.

### Lifespan
 
Due to the primal energy that defines their existence, Paleo Maidens possess a greatly extended lifespan, capable of living for several centuries. They age normally through childhood and adolescence, but upon reaching physical maturity—typically in their early twenties—the aging process slows dramatically. For the remainder of their long lives, they maintain the appearance of being in their physical prime.
 
This longevity has profound social and psychological effects. A Maiden will outlive her human parents, friends, and potentially even her own human-born children, leading to a unique and sometimes solitary perspective on the world. This extended life gives them ample time to master their abilities, but it also carries the weight of accumulated loss and memory, a burden that institutions like Stratum help them learn to manage. While they are not immortal, their natural lifespan far exceeds that of a normal human.

### Family Clades

Beyond their individual species, Paleo Maidens are also categorized into broader **Family Clades**, which reflect their shared paleontological ancestry. These groupings, such as the swift **Dromaeosauridae** (the "raptors"), the powerful **Abelisauridae**, or the immense **Titanosauria**, often hint at shared physical traits or predispositions. For instance, Maidens from the same clade might share similar body types, innate talents, or even a natural affinity for certain fighting styles.

These shared lineages are a significant part of a Maiden's identity and can foster deep bonds of camaraderie or, just as often, intense family rivalries. A Maiden's clade provides a sense of belonging but can also create a set of expectations to either live up to or, for some, to rebel against. The broadest of these divisions are the two great orders: the **Ornithischian** and **Saurischian** clades, which form the foundational divide in Paleo Maiden society and are reflected in the dormitory structure of the Stratum Institute.

### Paleo-Magic (P-Magic)

Paleo-Magic (P-Magic) is the manifestation of a Maiden's primal energy and serves as their direct **Health Pool** in combat. This system is what allows for high-stakes competition without the risk of fatal injury. Attacks deplete an opponent's P-Magic reserve rather than causing physical harm. A Maiden is defeated when her P-Magic reaches zero, resulting in a state of complete exhaustion that may cause her to lose focus or faint. Since every Maiden is born with a different P-Magic capacity, their innate durability and combat style can vary significantly.

While these attacks do not cause lasting physical injuries like cuts or broken bones, their impact is intensely real. P-Magic operates by directly interfacing with an opponent's life force, tricking their nervous system into simulating the effects of a physical blow. A strike from a P-Magic-conjured greatsword, for example, delivers not only a concussive jolt of energy but also inflicts the pure, agonizing *sensation* of a deep wound by directly stimulating the target's pain receptors. This neurological assault is what depletes P-Magic. The pain is real, the disorientation is real, but the physical body remains unharmed. It is the magical equivalent of taking a heavy body blow, felt throughout one's entire being, and it is this sensory overload that ultimately leads to exhaustion and defeat.
 
## The World

The geography of our world is one of profound duality. While humanity resides in nations mirroring the [Modern World Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_map), there exist other, more ancient lands. The **Primeval Continents**—[Pangea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangaea), [Laurasia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurasia), and [Gondwana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gondwana)—are vast, primordial landscapes where prehistoric plants still flourish, untouched by modern civilization. These wild continents are reserved as **sacred training grounds**, where Paleo Maidens can unleash their full power.

Though these ancient lands are their proving grounds, most Paleo Maidens are born into the civilized world, their extraordinary abilities first emerging within the familiar cities and towns of a world much like our own.

## Origin of the Stratum Institute, University of Paleo Maidens

### Founding and Philosophy

**Dr. Owen** (*An homage to [Sir Richard Owen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Owen)*) is the founder of the **Stratum Insitute**, a university housing multiple Paleo Maidens to help them train and hone their skills as Paleo Champions. Dr. Owen discovered that the Paleo Maidens have an innate instinct to fight resulting in his inscription that classify these Paleo Maidens as **δεινό**: *One's terror is the root of everyone's fear*, it is named as the Owen Inscription.

However, **Dr. Gideon** (*An homage to [Dr. Gideon Mantell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gideon_Mantell)*) sees the Paleo Maidens' innate instinct for combat as something to be inspired about. He was inspired after seeing a **Ornistishian Family** origin-Paleo Maiden, whom protected him from thugs- to which he proposed for the Paleo Maidens to inspire others and allow them to influence others with their prowess and special abilities. He would then propose the University to have the **Herbi Dorm**, initially dormitories for all Paleo Maidens. Dr Gideon later reinterpreted the Owen Inscription of **Deinos** as "**δεινό**. *One's terror is the root of everyone's awe*" 

### Structure and Curriculum

It was then discovered that, some Paleo Maidens have a higher tendency to spar and is quite rowdy compared to others, hence **Professor Buckland** (*An homage to [Prof. William Buckland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Buckland)*) proposed for a secondary dorm, the **Carni Dorm** to seperate them and control the chaotic nature of Paleo Maidens when bundled together.

With the Institute's foundation established, it was **Anning** (*An homage to [Mary Anning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Anning)*) who championed the hiring of a formal faculty of lecturers. Having been a brilliant, self-taught paleontologist who was often excluded by the academic elite of her time, she argued passionately that the Paleo Maidens needed more than just combat training. She insisted on a full university curriculum, believing that true strength came from understanding oneself and the world. It was her belief that with a proper education in science, history, and philosophy, the Maidens could become true leaders and authors of their own destiny, not just powerful tools to be wielded by others. Her advocacy led to the robust academic program that defines the Stratum Institute today.

## The Paleo Maiden Union and the Paleo World Championship

As Paleo Maidens became more integrated into society, the need for a global governing body became apparent. Thus, the **Paleo Maiden Union (PMU)** was established. The PMU serves as the international organization responsible for sanctioning official competitions, managing Maiden registrations, and establishing the rules of engagement for public sparring and championship events. Its primary charter, heavily influenced by Dr. Gideon's philosophy, is to promote Paleo Maidens as figures of inspiration and to provide a safe, structured outlet for their competitive instincts.

### The Paleo World Championship (World Cup)

The pinnacle of the PMU's efforts is the **Paleo World Championship**, often referred to simply as the **World Cup**. This massive global tournament is held every two years, bringing together teams of Paleo Maidens from nations across the world. It is a spectacle of skill, strategy, and power, broadcast to billions. The championship is more than just a series of fights; it's a cultural phenomenon that combines the prestige of the Olympics with the passionate rivalries of the FIFA World Cup. Events range from one-on-one duels in high-tech urban arenas to complex team-based objectives held on the treacherous landscapes of the Primeval Continents, testing not only the Maidens' combat prowess but also the leadership and tactical skills instilled by institutions like Stratum.

### Different Leagues for Different Maidens

While the World Cup is the ultimate prize, the PMU also oversees a regular season of professional competition. The world is divided into several major circuits, the two most prestigious being the **Apex League** and the **Bulwark League**. The Apex League is renowned for its focus on raw offensive power and spectacular one-on-one duels, attracting the most aggressive and powerful Maidens. In contrast, the Bulwark League emphasizes defense and endurance, showcasing tactical depth. Top-ranking teams and individuals from these and other regional leagues earn the right to compete in the biennial Paleo World Championship, making the regular season a grueling but essential path to global glory.


## Role of the Player

The player takes on the role of a **Lecturer** at the Stratum Institute, selecting a Paleo Maiden Champion (e.g., Tyran Rex, Sastrei Taurus) to mentor. Their goal is to guide your chosen Champion through a rigorous three-year curriculum, nurturing their skills and preparing them for the ultimate prize: the Paleo-Maiden Championship. While they manage their training schedule and guide them across the Primeval Continents, they are not alone. The institute's faculty is staffed by renowned paleontologist-professors—the very individuals who, in our world, discovered the fossils of the dinosaurs their Maidens are based on. For example, **Dr. Bonaparte** (*An homage based on [Dr. José Bonaparte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jos%C3%A9_Bonaparte)*) is the world's leading expert on Maidens like *Sastrei Taurus* and *Caza Amarga*. As a lecturer, players can consult these professors for invaluable insights into a Maiden's unique strengths and latent potential, helping them tailor their coaching for maximum efficiency. These professors, often rivals in their own academic fields, provide a rich source of guidance and competitive drama within the university.
