# The Stratum Institute: A World on the Waves

*"We do not merely train champions; we carry the future on the tide."*
― Founding Mandate of the Stratum Institute

---

## 1. Overview & Mission

The Stratum Institute is a sovereign, mobile university and the premier global institution for the education and training of Paleo Maidens. Conceived by Dr. Owen and realized through a monumental feat of international engineering, the Institute is a massive, man-made mobile habitat. With its iconic, near-spherical design reminiscent of a floating atoll, it travels the world's oceans under its own power. Its mission is twofold: to provide a safe and structured environment for Maidens to master their Paleo Arts, and to serve as a mobile bridge between the Modern World and the sacred Primeval Continents.

## 2. Vessel Specifications

The Institute is one of the largest self-propelled structures ever created, a floating city dedicated to science, sport, and self-discovery. Its immense mass requires an equally immense power source and advanced stabilizers to remain placid in even the roughest seas.

*   **Class:** Sovereign Mobile Habitat, Seascraper
*   **Diameter:** ~800 meters
*   **Height:** ~250 meters (including submerged sections)
*   **Displacement:** Over 2,000,000 tons
*   **Population:** Approx. 700 students, 4,500 faculty and crew.
*   **Power Source:** [To be determined - possibly a fusion core or a system that harnesses P-Magic?]
*   **Self-Sufficiency:** Capable of operating at sea for up to one year without resupply, utilizing advanced hydroponics, water desalination, and recycling systems.

## 3. Architectural Layout & Key Locations

The Institute's layout is radial, organized in concentric rings and vertical levels. The upper levels are exposed to the open air, while the lower levels are submerged beneath the waves.
    
*   **The Central Core:** The heart of the Institute.
    *   **The Apex Stadium:** At the very top of the institute is a massive, open-air arena with a retractable roof, used for major tournaments. Its floor can be configured into multiple simulated biomes.
    *   **The Academic Spire:** Directly beneath the stadium, this central tower forms the Institute's axis. It contains the multi-story Anning Library, lecture halls, research labs, and faculty offices.
*   **The Inner Ring (Promenade Level):** Surrounding the Central Core, this is the main social and commercial hub. It features a wide, circular promenade with shops, cafes, gyms, and lounges, all with panoramic views of the surrounding residential sectors.
*   **Residential Sectors:**
    *   **The Carni Sector ("The Warren"):** Occupying one entire hemisphere of the Institute. The architecture evokes a predator's mountain lair—powerful and secure, yet comfortable. Residential blocks are built from dark, geothermally-warmed stone, creating a network of cozy, den-like suites furnished with worn leather and thick hides. Communal spaces resemble grand lodges, centered around crackling fire pits where Maidens gather. While the training halls remain cavernous and the sparring pits are carved like arenas, they are places of pride, seamlessly connected to the warm and restful living quarters.
    *   **The Herbi Sector ("The Grove"):** Occupying the opposite hemisphere, The Grove is a marvel of ecological architecture. Residential suites are nestled within structures of living wood and polished white stone, interconnected by vine-covered sky-bridges. The design is open and airy, with terraced hydroponic gardens and waterfalls cascading through multi-level atriums. Communal life centers around sun-drenched plazas and amphitheaters woven into the landscape, fostering a deep sense of community. This living fortress, while serene, embodies resilience, with its flowing, organic lines forming a beautiful and unbreachable defense.
*   **The Sub-aquatic Levels:** The vast submerged portion of the Institute.
    *   **Engineering:** The deepest levels house the power core, propulsion systems, and maintenance workshops. Access is restricted to crew only.
    *   **Aquatic Facilities:** This section also contains specialized labs for marine biology and unique underwater training facilities.

## 4. Life at the Institute

A Maiden's daily life is a structured balance of academics, physical training, and personal time. The rivalry between the Carni and Herbi dorms is a constant, yet friendly, presence in campus life, often manifesting in organized competitions, prank wars, and spirited debates.

<!-- ## 5. Faculty & Key Personnel
