## Profile/Background

Tyran Rex is the **President of the Student Council** and the leader of the **Apex League (Carni Dorm)**.

Her political appointment is a **gamble by the Headmaster**, who recognized her raw, unparalleled potential despite her **chaotic past as the "Apex of the Underworld"—a notorious delinquent** who dominated underground fighting and training arenas. She was given the presidency not for her diplomacy, but to force her destructive energy into a legitimate, high-stakes challenge.

Crucially, Tyran is **oblivious** to the fear she inspires. She views her loud, demanding demeanor as necessary leadership, and her boasts as **motivational declarations** designed to push others to her level of strength. She believes students *respect* her methods, failing to realize they comply out of sheer **terror** stemming from rumors of her brutal delinquent history.

## Trivia

* Her signature move, Tyrant Divider, is an allegory for the T. rex's incredible bite force. The move doesn't rely on speed or finesse; it relies on overwhelming, crushing impact that ignores weak defenses.
* Her birthdate, the 5th of October is a special day for Palaeontology, as it marks the anniversary of the first description and naming of Tyrannosaurus rex, in 1905.
