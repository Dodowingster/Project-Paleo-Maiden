― Stenops Stegosa

## Real Life Counterpart Details

| Attribute | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Species** | *Stegosaurus stenops* (Meaning: "Roof Lizard" or "Covered Lizard") |
| **Era** | Late Jurassic |
| **Key Features** | Famous for the double row of kite-shaped plates along its back and the four lethal spikes on its tail (the Thagomizer). Historically mocked for having a small brain, a trait reflected in her tendency to seem "simple" or absent-minded. In reality, her mind is constantly led astray by her vast imagination, making it hard for her to focus on mundane reality. |
| **Lore Reflection** | Her **Duel Disk** shield represents the species' defensive nature. The "plates" are reimagined as **P-Magic Cards** representing the evolutionary history of the Deinos. She draws and slots these into her shield to conjure weapons and disasters. Normal cards invoke specific **Family Clades** (like *Theropoda* or *Abelisauridae*) as weapons, while her ultimate cards invoke the **Deinos Gods** (Sauris and Ornith) as catastrophic terrain effects. Her role as an artist references the "Thagomizer" term originating from a cartoon, bridging paleontology and art. |

## Profile/Background

Stenops Stegosa is the wildly enthusiastic and straightforward President of the **Institute Art Club**. She is the complete opposite of an introvert; she is a force of nature who speaks her mind with zero filter. At the Institute, she is often perceived as "simple-minded," but this is a misunderstanding. Her mind is not empty; it is overflowing. She struggles with complex academic theories and social cues because her imagination constantly hijacks her attention—a boring lecture instantly transforms into a mental painting of colliding colors, causing her to miss the actual lesson. She appears simple because she is perpetually distracted by her own artistic genius.

She is a **Tactician** who fights using a unique "Summoner" style. She carries a floral shaped small buckler that functions as a **Duel Disk**. By slotting her P-Magic Cards onto the disk, she summons the latent power of ancient lineages. She does not summon the creatures themselves, but rather their essence in the form of weapons or phenomena. This fighting style allows her to control the flow of battle from behind her defenses, though she often loudly announces her moves before making them.

On the battlefield, this overactive imagination makes her a prodigy. Where others see a battlefield, she sees a canvas. Unbound by rigid logic, she uses extreme creativity to conjure out-of-the-box solutions that baffle traditional tacticians. She treats every duel like a game of high-stakes cards, not calculating probabilities, but "drawing" upon wild, artistic inspiration to turn the tide. She believes wholeheartedly in the "Heart of the Cards"—or rather, her own stubborn will to win.

## Relationships (Friends/Rivals)

| Character | Relationship Type | Nature of Conflict/Bond |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Fragilis Allosa** | **Eternal Rival** | A clash of **Visual Arts vs. Musical Performance**. Their rivalry is defined by the desire to prove whose artistry holds more importance. While they bicker constantly to prove who is superior in both **Artistic Sense** and **Battle Sense**, they share a deep mutual respect for the medium of **Creativity**. They recognize each other as true artists, even if they disagree on the method. |
| **Horri Tricera** | **Mentor Figure** | A senior Ornithischian Maiden known for her absolute defense. Stegosa looks up to her as the pinnacle of the "Control" discipline. |

## Fighting Style

| Vocation | Core Trait | Signature Move |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Summoner** | **Deck of Phylogeny:** Stegosa fights using a deck of P-Magic cards representing the evolutionary tree. Her normal attacks utilize **Clade Cards**—summoning weapons or hazards themed around families like *Theropoda* (spectral claws/swords), *Ceratosauria* (horned shields), or *Abelisauridae* (crushing blunt weapons). | **God Card: Wrath of the Progenitors:** She plays a legendary card to invoke the power of **Sauris** or **Ornith**. These do not summon the gods, but manifest their power as catastrophes—such as **Sauris's Meteor** (a bombardment of fire) or **Ornith's Tsunami** (a crushing wave of water)—to reshape the battlefield and devastate the opponent. |

## Motivation and Goals

* **Primary Goal:** To prove that imagination and defense can overcome raw power and speed in the Paleo-Maiden Championship.
* **Internal Goal:** To create a "Masterpiece" of a battle—a duel so tactically perfect that it becomes art.

## Trivia

* The term **"Thagomizer"** (her tail spikes) was coined by cartoonist Gary Larson in *The Far Side*. Stegosa embraces this "artistic origin" by leading the Art Club.
* Her rivalry with **Fragilis Allosa** is historically rooted in the "Wounded Allosaurus" fossil, which shows a healed puncture wound in an *Allosaurus* vertebra that perfectly matches a *Stegosaurus* tail spike.
* Her birthdate, July 18th, is a reference to the year 1877 (18/7), the year *Stegosaurus* was named by Othniel Charles Marsh.
* Her design is inspired by **Kazuki Takahashi's *Yu-Gi-Oh!***, specifically the **Duel Disks**. The designer, **Dodowingster**, aligned the concept of the Duel Disk with the Stegosaurus's plates to create her unique design.
