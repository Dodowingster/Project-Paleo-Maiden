                            in her tendency to seem "simple" or absent-minded. In reality, her mind is constantly led
                            astray by her vast imagination, making it hard for her to focus on mundane reality.

                            draws and slots these into her shield to conjure weapons and disasters. Normal cards invoke
                            specific <strong>Family Clades</strong> (like <strong>Theropoda</strong> or
                            <strong>Abelisauridae</strong>) as weapons, while her
                            ultimate cards invoke the <strong>Deinos Gods</strong> (Sauris and Ornith) as catastrophic
                            terrain
                            effects. Her role as an artist references the "Thagomizer" term originating from a cartoon,
                            bridging paleontology and art.

            <!-- TODO: Write the character's background and personality here. -->
            <p>
                Stenops Stegosa is the wildly enthusiastic and straightforward President of the <strong>Institute Art
                    Club</strong>.
                She is the complete opposite of an introvert; she is a force of nature who speaks her mind with zero
                filter. At the Institute, she is often perceived as "simple-minded," but this is a misunderstanding. Her
                mind is not empty; it is overflowing. She struggles with complex academic theories and social cues
                because her imagination constantly hijacks her attention—a boring lecture instantly transforms into a
                mental painting of colliding colors, causing her to miss the actual lesson. She appears simple because
                she is perpetually distracted by her own artistic genius.
                <br />
                <br />
                She is a <strong>Tactician</strong> who fights using a unique "Summoner" style. She carries a floral
                shaped small
                buckler that functions as a <strong>Duel Disk</strong>. By slotting her P-Magic Cards onto the disk, she
                summons the
                latent power of ancient lineages. She does not summon the creatures themselves, but rather their essence
                in the form of weapons or phenomena. This fighting style allows her to control the flow of battle from
                behind her defenses, though she often loudly announces her moves before making them.
                <br />
                <br />
                On the battlefield, this overactive imagination makes her a prodigy. Where others see a battlefield, she
                sees a canvas. Unbound by rigid logic, she uses extreme creativity to conjure out-of-the-box solutions
                that baffle traditional tacticians. She treats every duel like a game of high-stakes cards, not
                calculating probabilities, but "drawing" upon wild, artistic inspiration to turn the tide. She believes
                wholeheartedly in the "Heart of the Cards"—or rather, her own stubborn will to win.
