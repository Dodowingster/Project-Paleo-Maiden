## Profile/Background

Caza Amarga is a Paleo-Maiden from the prestigious **Dicraeosauridae** family, affiliated with the **Bulwark League (Herbi Dorm)**. She is a kind, caring individual who often acts as a protective older sister figure, especially towards her childhood friend, Sastrei Taurus. However, her gentle nature belies a fierce internal struggle. Coming from a well-known lineage, she is constantly weighed down by the expectations to live up to her family's name, which is often compared unfavorably to larger, more powerful sauropod families like the Diplodocids such as Ajax Apato and Super Vivi. Her journey is one of self-acceptance, as she strives to prove that the unique strengths of her heritage are a legacy to be proud of, not a shadow to escape.

## Motivation and Goals

* **Primary Goal:** To win the **Paleo-Maiden Championship (PMC)** to bring honor to the Dicraeosauridae name on her own terms.
* **Internal Goal:** To overcome the immense pressure of her lineage and establish her own identity, proving that her worth is not defined by comparisons to others.

## Trivia

* Her childhood friendship with Sastrei Taurus (Carnotaurus) is a nod to real-life paleontology; the fossil remains of both the Amargasaurus and the Carnotaurus were found during the same expedition in Argentina, symbolizing their shared origins.
* Her family name, **Dicrae**, is derived from the **Dicraeosauridae** family her species belongs to. This family is known for its distinctive spinal formations, a trait Amarga is both proud of and burdened by.
* Her rivalry with other sauropods like Ajax Apato (Apatosaurus) reflects the paleontological distinctions between the Diplodocidae and Dicraeosauridae families within the larger Diplodocoidea superfamily.
