## Profile/Background

Nevesi Pycnonemo is a high-profile **Paleo Maiden** affiliated with the **Apex League (Carni Dorm)**. While her cousin Sastrei Taurus was born with a limited **P-Magic Pool**, Nevesi is a true prodigy, possessing immense natural reserves of primal energy. Born in Northern Brazil, she views combat as a theatrical performance designed to generate **Axé** (energy) from her adoring audience.

She embodies a "Regal Idol" persona, thriving on the fame of the **Paleo World Championship** circuit. However, her obsession with the **Roda** (the circle) hides a pathological jealousy. She adores her fans but views them as her "subjects," becoming insecure and aggressive if they shift their attention to underdogs like Sastrei. Her signature weapon is a single, ornate **Magical Armored Legging** on her right leg, which she uses to deliver crushing blow through her heavy, rhythmic fighting style.

## Motivation and Goals

* **Primary Goal:** To win the **PMC (Cretaceous League)** and secure the most prestigious Apex League contract in history.
* **Internal Goal:** To silence the fear that her strength is purely a byproduct of other people's validation.

## Trivia

* Her magical armored legging is a reference to the **Cangaceiros** of Northern Brazil—historical folk heroes known for leather armor.
* While Taurus is inspired by pure boxers, Nevesi's flashy, kick-based fighting style is inspired by characters like **Elena (Street Fighter)**, **Eddy Gordo (Tekken)**, **Tidus (Final Fantasy X)**, and **Gohan (Dragon Ball FighterZ)**. However despite being inspired with light-weighted characters, her design is going for the pollar opposite approach as in what if lightweight in motion but heavy in impcat direction.
* Her **Yellow (Control)** secondary discipline represents her "Thick Forest Lizard" roots, emphasizing unbreakable endurance.
* Her jealousy of Taurus is a nod to paleogeography, as her species was the dominant predator of the North while Taurus’s was in the South.
