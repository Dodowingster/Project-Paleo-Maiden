| **Species** | *Allosaurus fragilis* (Meaning: "Different Lizard") |
| **Era** | Late Jurassic |
| **Key Features** | The "Lion of the Jurassic." Known for the "hatchet bite" theory (using the upper jaw like an axe), prominent lacrimal crests (horns) above the eyes, and large hand claws. |

## Profile/Background

Fragilis Allosa is the **central protagonist** and the beating heart of the Stratum Institute. While she is admired as the "Maestro" for her sophisticated strategies and untouchable elegance, this persona hides a deeply relatable determination.

She works harder than anyone else to prove that **technique, legacy, and spirit** can overcome raw power. She is the bridge between the old and the new, the one who reaches out to rivals and friends alike to create a "Grand Symphony" where every Paleo Maiden can find their stage. Her journey is not just about winning; it's about defining what it means to be a champion in a changing world.

In a P-Magic duel, she fights with the elegance of a high-born fencer, treating her radiant crimson Sabre like a conductor's baton. She embodies the "Lion of the Jurassic"—a predator of nobility and ferocity. She is the **"Special Star"** of the franchise, the character whose growth mirrors the player's journey.

## Relationships (Friends/Rivals)

| Character | Relationship Type | Nature of Conflict/Bond |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stenops Stegosa** | **Eternal Rival** | A clash of **Musical Performance vs. Visual Arts**. Their rivalry is defined by the desire to prove whose artistry holds more importance. While they bicker constantly to prove who is superior in both **Artistic Sense** and **Battle Sense**, they share a deep mutual respect for the medium of **Creativity**. They recognize each other as true artists, even if they disagree on the method. |
| **Longus Diplo** | **The Unreachable Wall** | A massive Sauropod Maiden who represents the sheer scale Allosa must overcome. While Allosa is the "Lion," Diplo is the mountain. Allosa views defeating her as the ultimate proof of skill over size. |
| **Ostromm Utahra** | **Territorial Rival** | A political and territorial clash over who truly represents their home state. Allosa holds the prestigious, long-standing title of "State Maiden", but Utahra has recently gained massive popularity, claiming the specific title of "State Maiden." Allosa views Utahra as a rude upstart trying to usurp her established legacy. |

## Vocation Evolution(s)

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base** | Crimson Fencer | **Red** (Brute/Power) |
| **Final** | Vermilion Red Mage | **Red** (Power) + **Blue** (Focus) |

## Fighting Style

| Vocation | Core Trait | Signature Move |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Crimson Fencer** | **Regal Aggression:** Allosa fights with a one-handed Sabre style that emphasizes wide, chopping slashes (mimicking the hatchet bite) and elegant footwork. She uses her **Red** affinity to empower her blade with explosive energy, turning graceful fencing into shield-shattering heavy attacks. | **Hatchet Waltz:** Allosa performs a series of elegant dashes to confuse the enemy, ending with a vertical, two-handed overhead slash that crashes down with the weight of a guillotine. |
| **Vermilion Red Mage** | **Versatile Mastery:** Evolving to incorporate **Focus (Blue)**, she mixes magic with martial prowess. She can now enchant her blade with elemental P-Magic or cast quick defensive wards, weaving spells into her combos with cunning precision. | **Ballad of Big Al:** Allosa kicks her opponent away, then levitates her Sabre. Like a conductor, she orchestrates a flurry of exactly 9 strikes (one for each note on her attire) that launch the enemy skyward. She then recalls the blade to her hand and unleashes a piercing energy blow at the airborne target, ending with a stylish hands-on-hat pose. |

## Motivation and Goals

* **Primary Goal:** To become the **"Primeval Queen"** (The Top Paleo Maiden) and defend her title as the "Champion of Utah," proving that the classics can outshine even the trendiest modern rivals.
* **Internal Goal:** To overcome her anxiety of obsolescence and show the world that her "melody" is timeless.

## Trivia

* Her attire features **9 musical notes**, which are a stylized reference to **"Big Al" (MOR 693)**, a famous Allosaurus specimen found with **19 healed fractures**. She has condensed the 19 injuries into 9 distinct fashion statements. This number is directly referenced in her signature move, **Ballad of Big Al**, which consists of exactly **19 strikes**. The notes are:
    1.  **8th Note** (Left Hat)
    2.  **Treble Clef** (Left Hat)
    3.  **Segno Note** (Center of Hat)
    4.  **Alto Clef** (Necktie Clip)
    5.  **Bass Clef** (Emblem on neck with ribbons and wings)
    6.  **Beam Note** (Right Hat)
    7.  **Coda Note** (Brooch pinning right side cloak)
    8.  **Natural Sign** (Vest buttons)
    9.  **Whole Note** (Vest buttons connecting to Natural Sign)
* Her "Red Mage" design (feathered hat and cape) is a nod to the **lacrimal crests** (horns) above an Allosaurus's eyes, which are often depicted as red or colorful in paleo-art for display purposes.
* The "Hatchet Waltz" signature move references the controversial **"Hatchet Bite" theory**, which suggested Allosaurus used its upper jaw like an axe to hack at prey.
* Her conducting style is inspired by **Herbert von Karajan**, specifically his intense, eyes-closed focus. This symbolizes how she shuts out distractions to channel her P-Magic perfectly during her "Ballad of Big Al" signature move.
* Her rivalry with **Ostromm Utahra** is based on Utah state legislation. **Allosaurus** was designated the **State Fossil of Utah** in 1988. However, in 2018, **Utahraptor** was designated the **State Dinosaur**, effectively splitting the title and creating a "turf war" over who is the true representative of the state.
* As the **"Face of the Project,"** she is designed to be the most balanced and adaptable fighter (The "Ryu" or "Mario" archetype), making her the perfect entry point for new players (Trainers).
