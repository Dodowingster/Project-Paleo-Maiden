― Fragilis Allosa

## Real Life Counterpart Details

| Attribute | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Species** | *Allosaurus fragilis* (Meaning: "Different Lizard") |
| **Era** | Late Jurassic |
| **Key Features** | The "Lion of the Jurassic." Known for the "hatchet bite" theory (using the upper jaw like an axe), prominent lacrimal crests (horns) above the eyes, and large hand claws. |
| **Lore Reflection** | Her **Sabre** fighting style mimics the slashing "hatchet bite" motion. Her **Red Mage** aesthetic (feathered hat, red coat) references the prominent crests and the species' status as a successful, widespread generalist. Her clumsiness references the famous specimen "Big Al," who suffered from 19 documented injuries and infections. |

## Profile/Background

Fragilis Allosa is the spirited, relatable heart of the Stratum Institute. Often called the "Special Star" by her friends, she possesses immense latent potential but is plagued by a comical degree of bad luck in her daily life. She is notoriously clumsy—tripping over flat surfaces, walking into glass doors, or accidentally knocking over displays with her tail. She is a frequent visitor to the infirmary for minor scrapes and bruises, earning her the affectionate nickname "Band-Aid Princess."

Despite her clumsiness, she commands respect as the **Conductor of the Institute Music Club**. Her signature "Red Mage" aesthetic—the feathered hat and long coat—is actually inspired by her love for theatrical performance and conducting attire. The moment she steps into a P-Magic duel, her demeanor shifts instantly. The clumsiness vanishes, replaced by the regal grace of a maestro. She fights with the elegance of a high-born fencer, treating her radiant crimson Sabre like a conductor's baton. She embodies the "Lion of the Jurassic"—a predator of nobility and ferocity. Her journey is one of reconciling these two halves: proving that a "fragile" girl who trips over her own feet can still rise to orchestrate a masterpiece in the arena.

## Relationships (Friends/Rivals)

| Character | Relationship Type | Nature of Conflict/Bond |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stenops Stegosa** | **Eternal Rival** | They are polar opposites who bicker like cats and dogs constantly. These two are inseparable frenemies. Stegosa's defensive, calculated nature perfectly counters Allosa's aggressive style, making them the ultimate sparring partners who push each other to the limit. |
| **Longus Diplo** | **The Unreachable Wall** | A massive Sauropod Maiden who represents the sheer scale Allosa must overcome. While Allosa is the "Lion," Diplo is the mountain. Allosa views defeating her as the ultimate proof of skill over size. |
| **Ostromm Utahra** | **Territorial Rival** | Utahra covets Allosa's status as the premier predator of the American West. While Allosa tries to be friendly, Utahra's intense competitiveness forces them into clashes over who truly owns the title of "Champion." |

## Vocation Evolution(s)

| **Final** | Vermilion Red Mage | **Red** (Power) + **Blue** (Focus) |

## Fighting Style

| Vocation | Core Trait | Signature Move |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Crimson Fencer** | **Regal Aggression:** Allosa fights with a one-handed Sabre style that emphasizes wide, chopping slashes (mimicking the hatchet bite) and elegant footwork. She uses her **Red** affinity to empower her blade with explosive energy, turning graceful fencing into shield-shattering heavy attacks. | **Hatchet Waltz:** Allosa performs a series of elegant dashes to confuse the enemy, ending with a vertical, two-handed overhead slash that crashes down with the weight of a guillotine. |
| **Vermilion Red Mage** | **Versatile Mastery:** Evolving to incorporate **Focus (Blue)**, she mixes magic with martial prowess. She can now enchant her blade with elemental P-Magic or cast quick defensive wards, covering her reckless offensive style with calculated protection. | **Ballad of Big Al:** Allosa kicks her opponent away, then levitates her Sabre. Like a conductor, she orchestrates a flurry of exactly 19 strikes that launch the enemy skyward. She then recalls the blade to her hand and unleashes a piercing energy blow at the airborne target, ending with a stylish hands-on-hat pose. |

## Motivation and Goals

* **Primary Goal:** To win the Paleo-Maiden Championship and prove that her "fragile" nature is not a weakness, but a testament to her ability to survive and recover.
* **Internal Goal:** To stop tripping in front of her crush/fans and to finally defeat Stenops Stegosa without flinching at the sight of the spikes.

## Trivia

* Her clumsiness and "fragile" moniker are direct references to **"Big Al" (MOR 693)**, a famous Allosaurus specimen found with **19 healed fractures** and signs of infection. This number is directly referenced in her signature move, **Ballad of Big Al**, which consists of exactly **19 strikes**.
* Her "Red Mage" design (feathered hat and cape) is a nod to the **lacrimal crests** (horns) above an Allosaurus's eyes, which are often depicted as red or colorful in paleo-art for display purposes.
* The "Hatchet Waltz" signature move references the controversial **"Hatchet Bite" theory**, which suggested Allosaurus used its upper jaw like an axe to hack at prey.
* Her conducting style is inspired by **Herbert von Karajan**, specifically his intense, eyes-closed focus. This symbolizes how she shuts out the world (and her own clumsiness) to channel her P-Magic perfectly during her "Ballad of Big Al" signature move.
