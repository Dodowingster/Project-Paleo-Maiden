## Profile/Background

Fragilis Allosa is the sophisticated, cunning strategist of the Stratum Institute. Often called the "Maestro" by her peers, she possesses immense latent potential and carries herself with an air of untouchable elegance. She is stylish and presentable at all times, notoriously smooth—gliding through social situations and battlefields alike with calculated grace.

She commands respect as the **Conductor of the Institute Music Club**. Her signature "Red Mage" aesthetic—the feathered hat and long coat—is inspired by her love for theatrical performance and conducting attire. She often incorporates musical metaphors into her strategies, viewing each duel as a symphony where every move must be perfectly timed and executed.

In a P-Magic duel, she fights with the elegance of a high-born fencer, treating her radiant crimson Sabre like a conductor's baton. She embodies the "Lion of the Jurassic"—a predator of nobility and ferocity. Her journey is one of proving that true strength lies in turning one's history into a masterpiece.

| Character | Relationship Type | Nature of Conflict/Bond |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Stenops Stegosa** | **Eternal Rival** | They are polar opposites who bicker like cats and dogs constantly. These two are inseparable frenemies. Stegosa's defensive, calculated nature perfectly counters Allosa's aggressive style, making them the ultimate sparring partners who push each other to the limit. |
| **Longus Diplo** | **The Unreachable Wall** | A massive Sauropod Maiden who represents the sheer scale Allosa must overcome. While Allosa is the "Lion," Diplo is the mountain. Allosa views defeating her as the ultimate proof of skill over size. |
| **Ostromm Utahra** | **Territorial Rival** | Utahra covets Allosa's status as the premier predator of the American West. While Allosa tries to be friendly, Utahra's intense competitiveness forces them into clashes over who truly owns the title of "Champion." |

## Fighting Style

| Vocation | Core Trait | Signature Move |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Crimson Fencer** | **Regal Aggression:** Allosa fights with a one-handed Sabre style that emphasizes wide, chopping slashes (mimicking the hatchet bite) and elegant footwork. She uses her **Red** affinity to empower her blade with explosive energy, turning graceful fencing into shield-shattering heavy attacks. | **Hatchet Waltz:** Allosa performs a series of elegant dashes to confuse the enemy, ending with a vertical, two-handed overhead slash that crashes down with the weight of a guillotine. |
| **Vermilion Red Mage** | **Versatile Mastery:** Evolving to incorporate **Focus (Blue)**, she mixes magic with martial prowess. She can now enchant her blade with elemental P-Magic or cast quick defensive wards, weaving spells into her combos with cunning precision. | **Ballad of Big Al:** Allosa kicks her opponent away, then levitates her Sabre. Like a conductor, she orchestrates a flurry of exactly 9 strikes (one for each note on her attire) that launch the enemy skyward. She then recalls the blade to her hand and unleashes a piercing energy blow at the airborne target, ending with a stylish hands-on-hat pose. |

## Motivation and Goals

* **Primary Goal:** To win the Paleo-Maiden Championship and prove that elegance and cunning are the ultimate weapons of a predator.
* **Internal Goal:** To compose the perfect battle strategy that defeats Stenops Stegosa without a single hair out of place.

## Trivia

* Her attire features **9 musical notes**, which are a stylized reference to **"Big Al" (MOR 693)**, a famous Allosaurus specimen found with **19 healed fractures**. She has condensed the 19 injuries into 9 distinct fashion statements. This number is directly referenced in her signature move, **Ballad of Big Al**, which consists of exactly **19 strikes**. The notes are:
    1.  **8th Note** (Left Hat)
    2.  **Treble Clef** (Left Hat)
    3.  **Segno Note** (Center of Hat)
    4.  **Alto Clef** (Necktie Clip)
    5.  **Bass Clef** (Emblem on neck with ribbons and wings)
    6.  **Beam Note** (Right Hat)
    7.  **Coda Note** (Brooch pinning right side cloak)
    8.  **Natural Sign** (Vest buttons)
    9.  **Whole Note** (Vest buttons connecting to Natural Sign)
* Her "Red Mage" design (feathered hat and cape) is a nod to the **lacrimal crests** (horns) above an Allosaurus's eyes, which are often depicted as red or colorful in paleo-art for display purposes.
* The "Hatchet Waltz" signature move references the controversial **"Hatchet Bite" theory**, which suggested Allosaurus used its upper jaw like an axe to hack at prey.
* Her conducting style is inspired by **Herbert von Karajan**, specifically his intense, eyes-closed focus. This symbolizes how she shuts out distractions to channel her P-Magic perfectly during her "Ballad of Big Al" signature move.
