            <!-- TODO: Write the character's background and personality here. -->
            <p>
                Kitadani Fukuira is an intense, honorable, and deeply disciplined Paleo Maiden. While not officially
                affiliated with a specific league's philosophy (she considers herself a student of the
                <strong>Bushidō</strong>
                tradition).
                <br><br>
                Her life is dedicated to the pursuit of the <strong>Flawless Draw</strong>—a single, instantaneous
                strike that ends
                the fight decisively and cleanly. She is not a cold fighter, but her extreme focus on <strong>P-Magic
                    Purity</strong>
                often makes her appear cold and intimidating to those around her, as she radiates an aura of unwavering
                resolve. Her true goal is to prove that <strong>mastery and honor</strong> always surpass brute force
                and luck.
                <br><br>
                However, due to her obssessiveness towards the purity of her own P-Magic concentration, she often has a
                strong distaste towards negative associted things such as curse words or anything that she believes
                would taint her P-Magic- leading to her being overly protective towards her hygience and takes extreme
                measures to keep it "pure".

                            Fukuira values P-Magic purity and honor above all. Utahra is a pragmatist who focuses on
                            effectiveness, even using tactics Fukuira deems "dishonorable," like sabotaging an
                            opponent's P-Magic. Their conflict is a battle of principle vs. pragmatism.
