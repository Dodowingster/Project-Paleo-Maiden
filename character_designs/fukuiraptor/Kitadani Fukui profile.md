## Profile/Background

Kitadani Fukui is an intense, honorable, and deeply disciplined Paleo Maiden. While not officially affiliated with a specific league's philosophy (she considers herself a student of the **Bushidō** tradition).

Her life is dedicated to the pursuit of the **Flawless Draw**—a single, instantaneous strike that ends the fight decisively and cleanly. She is not a cold fighter, but her extreme focus on **P-Magic Purity** often makes her appear cold and intimidating to those around her, as she radiates an aura of unwavering resolve. Her true goal is to prove that **mastery and honor** always surpass brute force and luck.

However, due to her obssessiveness towards the purity of her own P-Magic concentration, she often has a strong distaste towards negative associted things such as curse words or anything that she believes would taint her P-Magic- leading to her being overly protective towards her hygience and takes extreme measures to keep it "pure".

## Relationships (Friends/Rivals)

| Character | Relationship Type | Nature of Conflict/Bond |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ostromm Utahra** | **Ideological Rival** | Fukui values P-Magic purity and honor above all. Utahra is a pragmatist who focuses on effectiveness, even using tactics Fukui deems "dishonorable," like sabotaging an opponent's P-Magic. Their conflict is a battle of principle vs. pragmatism. |

## Fighting Style

| Vocation | Core Trait | Signature Move |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Iai Blade Master** | **Deceptive Power:** Her style mimics the speed and precision of *Iaijutsu*. She uses a katana with a two-handed grip, focusing on perfect form and patience. Opponents mistake her stance for that of a swift, light-damage fighter, but each draw is a surprisingly powerful slash meant to end the exchange decisively. | **Sakura's First Bloom:** A defensive stance that culminates in a swift, clean katana draw. If she blocks an attack while in this stance, the counter-attack is a single, devastatingly powerful slash that deals significantly increased damage, rewarding a perfect read. |
| **Shogunate Swordsman** | **The Flawless Cleave:** Fusing her Blue discipline with Red's raw power, her style becomes relentlessly proactive. She now embodies the "Nōdachi in a katana's form," using her speed to create openings for single, overwhelming slashes that carry the full, cleaving force of a Megaraptoran's claw. | **Kitadani Cleaver:** Kitadani channels all her P-Magic into a single, unblockable draw-slash. The move has a long charge time but is executed with blinding speed. Its damage scales with the amount of P-Magic stored, capable of ending a fight with one pure, perfect, and overwhelmingly powerful strike. |

## Trivia

* Her fighting animations feature a scattering of **Sakura petals**, symbolizing the **brief, beautiful, and decisive nature** of her *Iai* draw (a classic Bushidō metaphor).
* Her physical appearance and attire are designed to make her look like a standard, agile **Katana master** (Dromaeosaurid), but her immensely powerful and deliberate attacks surprise rivals with the **cleaving force of a Megaraptoran/Nōdachi**.
* The ritual of purifying her P-Magic after a fight is done with a traditional **Japanese breathing exercise** (Kokyū-hō) that focuses her energy flow.
* Her birthdate (May 13th) is a direct numerical reference to the year of her discovery in the **Kitadani Formation (1994)**. The number 13 is derived from summing the last two digits of the year ($9+4=13$). The month (May) is chosen to symbolize the **traditional Spring season** associated with the delicate yet powerful Sakura motif.
