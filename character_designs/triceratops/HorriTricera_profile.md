― Horri Tricera

## Real Life Counterpart Details

| Attribute | Detail |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Species** | *Triceratops horridus* (Meaning: "Rough Three-Horned Face") |
| **Era** | Late Cretaceous |
| **Key Features** | A massive bony frill, three distinct facial horns, and a parrot-like beak. Known for being one of the last non-avian dinosaurs to evolve. |
| **Lore Reflection** | Her **Control (Yellow)** discipline mirrors the defensive utility of the frill. Her "Cowboy/Sheriff" aesthetic plays on the "herding" nature of ceratopsians and the rugged durability required to survive apex predators like the T-Rex. |

## Profile/Background

Horri Tricera is the **Vice President of the Student Council** and the *de facto* leader of the **Herbi Dorm**.

**Raised on a remote ranch in Wyoming by a family of traditional cowboys**, Horri's childhood was defined by hard labor, discipline, and the vast, open frontier. She learned to ride and rope alongside seasoned hands, absorbing the stoic code of the West. Yet, while her family focused on the livestock, Horri became obsessed with the machinery—fixing tractors and modifying old revolvers. This upbringing forged her unique identity: a cowgirl with the mind of an engineer.

While Tyran Rex is the explosive figurehead of the Institute, Horri is the unshakeable foundation that keeps it from crumbling. Stoic, pragmatic, and tirelessly dependable, she is the one who actually ensures the paperwork is filed and the budget is balanced. This reliability has earned her immense respect among the students, who view her as the "cool, composed upperclassman" who can solve any problem with a level head.

However, beneath her stern exterior lies a burning, geeky passion: **Magitech Engineering**. Horri is obsessed with tinkering and combining her P-Magic with mechanical technology (specifically **Gunsmithy**). While most see this as an eccentric hobby, she pursues it with academic rigor in the secluded archives of Mary Anning's library. This open secret is a source of amusement for Tyran, but a point of serious academic collaboration with Anning.

On the battlefield, her relationship with Tyran shifts from administrative partnership to a legendary rivalry. Horri is one of the few Maidens capable of withstanding Tyran's full power, pitting her "Immovable Object" defense against Tyran's "Unstoppable Force."

## Relationships (Friends/Rivals)

| Character | Relationship Type | Nature of Conflict/Bond |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Tyran Rex** | **President / Arch-Rival** | They are inseparable partners in governance but mortal enemies in the ring. Tyran tries to break Horri's defense; Horri tries to exhaust Tyran's offense. It is a bond forged in the fire of their ancestors' ancient war. |
| **Latus Torosa** | **Family Rival** | A conflict defined by **Tradition vs. Innovation**. Latus dismisses Horri's "Magitech" experiments as "juvenile toys," claiming true power doesn't need gadgets. Horri fights to prove her engineering is the next stage of evolution. |
| **Stenops Stegosa** | **Friend** | Horri recognizes Stegosa's defensive potential but often finds herself lecturing the Art Club President on the importance of focus. She acts as the grounding anchor to Stegosa's wild imagination. |
| **Mary Anning** | **Academic Patron** | While reliance on raw P-Magic is the norm, Anning is the sole faculty member who wholeheartedly champions Horri's "Magitech" research. She provides critical feedback, grants access to restricted archives, and treats Horri's tinkering not as a hobby, but as a legitimate pioneering field of study. |

## Vocation Evolution(s)

| Stage | Vocation Title | Fused Trait Disciplines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base** | **Warden** | **Control (Yellow)** |
| **Hybrid** | **Mystic Enforcer** | **Control + Focus** |

## Fighting Style

| Vocation | Core Trait | Signature Move |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Warden** | **Zone Control:** Utilizes her P-Magic **Lasso** to pull opponents into range and her custom-built **Tri-horned P-Magic Tower Kite Shield**—a product of her own Magitech tinkering—for devastating shield bashes. She controls the spacing of the fight, dragging enemies into her defensive perimeter. | **Trident Buster:** She lassos her opponent and pulls them in while charging her shield, unleashing a devastating forward charge that slams the target with the full weight of her defense. |
| **Mystic Enforcer** | **Arcane Projection:** Gains the ability to conjure energy waves using the **Focus** discipline. She transforms her custom shield from a defensive bulwark into an offensive emitter, controlling the battlefield with sweeping magical currents. | **Trident Pulsar:** The horns on her Tower Kite Shield rotate outwards. She charges an orb of electrical magical energy at the center of the horns before bursting a massive beam towards her opponents, causing widespread explosions. |

## Motivation and Goals

* **Primary Goal (The Bulwark Champion):** To win the **Bulwark League** using her controversial **"Magitech"** style. She aims to prove that her so-called "juvenile" gadgets are superior to traditional biological might, silencing critics like Latus Torosa on the competitive stage.
* **Internal Goal (The First Technomancer):** To be recognized as the world's first **Grand Technomancer**. She seeks to validate her identity as an inventor, proving that her passion for engineering is the future of P-Magic, not just a hobby.

## Trivia

* Her birthday, September 26th, is a reference to the year (1889) the first *Triceratops* skull was collected by George Lyman Cannon. The day (26) is a numerical reference to the year ($18 + 8 = 26$).
* Her Cowboy design is a nod to John Bell Hatcher, the paleontologist who discovered the first *Triceratops* fossils and was known for being a cowboy.
* Her geekiness on Gunsmithy is also a nod to the Wild West.
* The rivalry between Horri and Tyran is historically accurate, as *Triceratops* and *Tyrannosaurus* were contemporaries in the Late Cretaceous period and are known to have fought each other. This rivalry is famously immortalized in museums worldwide where their fossils are often exhibited together in combat poses, solidifying their status as eternal rivals.
* Her rivalry with Latus Torosa references the paleontological hypothesis that *Triceratops* was actually a **juvenile form of *Torosaurus***. In the lore, this translates to Latus criticizing Horri's use of technology/gadgets as "immature" compared to traditional power.
* Her design is heavily inspired by the **Wild Arms** video game soundtrack and the iconic **Clint Eastwood**.
