## Profile/Background

Sastrei Taurus is a Paleo-Maiden affiliated with the **Apex League (Carni Dorm)**, but she is an ideological rebel within it. Unlike her peers, she was born with a **less abundant P-Magic pool** and lower innate **Stamina**. This forced her to reject the Carni philosophy of overwhelming **Brute Force**. Instead, she committed to mastering **Agility and Precision**, which are the core traits of the rival **Bulwark League (Herbi Dorm)**'s philosophy. She is a dedicated **Lone Wolf** who trains obsessively to prove that technique can surpass inherited power.

## Relationships (Friends/Rivals)

| Character | Relationship Type | Nature of Conflict/Bond |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Berniss Iguan** (Iguanodon) | **Thematic Rival** | They share the goal of **fighting against arbitrary limits** (species expectations). Their rivalry is a clash of methods: Agility vs. Power. |
| **Caza Amarga** (Amargasaurus) | **Childhood Friend/Academic Rival**. | Amarga dotes and worries on her and treats her like a little sister which seem liked it annoys Taurus but she actually does not mind and used to her. |
| **Tyran Rex** (Tyrannosaurus) | **Respected Figure** | Sastrei deeply respects Tyran as the ultimate embodiment of raw power. Far from a political opponent, she views Tyran as the final benchmark to overcome. She is not afraid to challenge her, believing that a duel is the only way to prove that her hard-won technique can triumph over inherited might. |
| **Nevesi Pycnonemo** (Pycnonemosaurus) | **Family Rivalry** | Being both from the same Abeli Family origins, Taurus often be seen bickering with Pycnonemo flaunting her superiority over Taurus. |

## Vocation Evolution(s)

| Stage | Vocation Title | Fused Trait Disciplines |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Base** | Kinetic Boxer | Agility (Core) |
| **Hybrid** | Boxing Magus | Agility + Stamina/Arcane Precision |

> *The Boxing Magus style fuses Taurus's raw **Agility** with a stable flow of P-Magic (Stamina/Arcane Precision) to deliver powerful, consistent strikes that maintain momentum without depleting her small reserves.*

## Fighting Style

| Vocation | Core Trait | Signature Move |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Kinetic Boxer** | **Agility & Precision:** Her style is built around constant movement, evading damage, and landing quick, successive strikes where they matter most. | **Sastrei Carnage:** A multi-hit flurry of punches culminating in a devastating uppercut. This move commits her limited P-Magic pool for a high-risk, decisive finish. |
| **Boxing Magus** | **Arcane-Enhanced Agility:** Uses P-Magic for extended-range **Flicker Jabs** to taunt and bait opponents, while also focusing P-Magic into her feet for enhanced **Speed and Agility**. | **Dicrae Hellion:**  A catastrophic initial blow sends the opponent flying, then engages Light-Speed Pursuit, chasing them down from multiple vectors with impossible velocity, culminating in a powerful, screen-shattering uppercut. |

## Motivation and Goals

* **Primary Goal:** To win the **Paleo-Maiden Championship (PMC)** and secure the most prestigious post-graduation contract.
* **Internal Goal:** To achieve a style so flawless that she is never forced to rely on a large P-Magic pool for survival.

## Trivia

* Her combat heels force her into an aggressive, forward-leaning stance, embodying the **Theropod's digitigrade** gait and maximizing the momentum of her strikes.
* Her childhood friendship with Caza Amarga (Amargasaurus) is a nod to real-life paleontology; the fossil remains of both the Carnotaurus and the Amargasaurus were found during the same expedition in Argentina, symbolizing their shared origins.
* Her birthdate (27th April) is a direct reference to when her irl counterpart was found which is the year 1984. The day (27) is a numerical reference to the 1984 discovery year ($19 + 8 = 27$) of her real-life counterpart.
* A lot of her moveset, animations, fighting style and design are inspired by fighting game characters that belong in the same archetype: boxing. Which are Ed from Street Fighter, Akihiko Sanada from Persona 4 Arena Ultimax and Makoto Nanaya from Blazblue. 
* The fierce Family Rivalry with Nevesi Pycnonemo (Pycnonemosaurus) is rooted in paleogeography. Pycnonemosaurus (found in the northern region of South America) is a potentially larger Abelisaurid than Carnotaurus (found in the south), creating a lore conflict between Sastrei's Agility and Nevesi's inherited Brute Force/Size within their own family line.
