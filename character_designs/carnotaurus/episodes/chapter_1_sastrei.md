# Chapter 1: The President's Summons

**[SCENE START]**

**LOCATION:** Stratum Institute - Hallway outside the Student Council Room - Morning

**BACKGROUND:** The hallway is wide and impressive, lined with banners of past champions. The door to the Student Council Room is slightly ajar. The LECTURER is walking by, presumably on their way to their official onboarding session.

**LECTURER (V.O. / Internal Monologue):**
After last night, I was looking forward to a quiet, formal start to my tenure. A meeting with the Student Council President, a tour of the facilities... simple.

Suddenly, a furious voice erupts from the Student Council Room, sharp enough to cut through the morning calm. It's Sastrei Taurus.

**SASTREI TAURUS (O.S.):**
SO YOU'RE SAYING I SHOULD LET THEM BE MUGGED BY THOSE PUNKS?!!!

The Lecturer stops, surprised. They recognize that voice. They cautiously approach the door, peering through the small opening.

**LOCATION:** Student Council Room - Interior

**BACKGROUND:** The room is grand, dominated by a large, imposing desk where TYRAN REX sits. Sastrei Taurus stands before the desk, fists clenched at her sides, glaring at the President.

**TYRAN REX:**
(Leaning back in her chair, voice booming and matter-of-fact)
I'm saying a report was filed. "A Paleo Maiden was seen violently assaulting three individuals in a downtown alley." The rules are clear, Taurus. Using your abilities on civilians is forbidden. It causes panic. It makes us look like monsters.

**SASTREI TAURUS:**
"Assaulting"? They pulled a gun! They were robbing someone! They were robbing *your* new lecturer! What was I supposed to do, ask them nicely to stop?

**TYRAN REX:**
(Frowning, completely missing the nuance)
You were supposed to disengage and report it. That is the protocol. An armed threat is a matter for the local authorities, not for a student to handle with her fists. It is not our place to interfere.

**SASTREI TAURUS:**
(Scoffs in disbelief)
Not our place? So we just stand by and watch? That's your idea of strength, President? Following rules that protect thugs?

The tension is thick enough to cut with a knife. The Lecturer realizes this is their story being twisted. They can't let this misunderstanding continue. Taking a breath, they push the door open and step inside.

**LECTURER:**
Excuse me. I couldn't help but overhear.

Both Sastrei and Tyran turn, surprised by the interruption. Sastrei's angry expression shifts to one of shock, while Tyran raises an eyebrow.

**LECTURER:**
President Rex, I am the lecturer Sastrei mentioned. What she said is true. We were lost, and those men cornered us. They were threatening us, and one of them had a firearm. Sastrei didn't "assault" anyone. She defended us.

The Lecturer looks directly at Tyran, their voice firm and clear.

**LECTURER:**
She didn't use any P-Magic. She simply... intervened. If she hadn't, I can't say for certain what would have happened to me or to Caza Amarga. In my view, her actions were not only justified, they were heroic.

A heavy silence falls over the room.

Sastrei stares at the Lecturer, her mouth slightly agape. The fiery anger in her eyes is gone, replaced by wide-eyed disbelief. She seems completely wrong-footed, her defensive posture slackening. She quickly looks away, pulling her hood down a little further as if to hide her expression, a faint blush creeping up her neck.

Tyran Rex leans forward, resting her elbows on the massive desk and steepling her fingers. She studies the Lecturer, then glances at the flustered Sastrei. A low chuckle rumbles in her chest.

**TYRAN REX:**
(Voice still booming, but with a new note of amusement)
"Heroic," you say. And no P-Magic against an armed opponent... Hmph.
(She looks back at Sastrei)
The report is nullified. You're dismissed, Taurus. Try not to get any more civilian complaints filed against you, justified or not. Perchance, if I still hear another word of similar cases, you will be answering to me personally.

Sastrei flinches at the direct address, gives a barely perceptible nod, and practically flees the room without another word, shutting the door quietly behind her. The threat of answering to Rex personally is clearly more intimidating than any formal punishment.

Tyran Rex turns her full, intimidating attention back to the Lecturer, but the sternness is gone. A genuine, toothy grin is in its place.

**TYRAN REX:**
Well, Lecturer. It seems your onboarding session has already begun. Please, have a seat. You've just made things very interesting.

The Lecturer takes the offered seat, their mind still replaying the events of the previous night.

**LECTURER:**
Thank you, President Rex. If I may, I'd like to know more about Sastrei Taurus. Her fighting style... it was unlike anything I've studied. No P-Magic, just pure physical skill. It was remarkable.

Tyran leans back, a thoughtful look on her face. Her booming voice takes on a more analytical tone, like a coach discussing a star player.

**TYRAN REX:**
Remarkable is one word for it. Stubborn is another. You are correct, she uses her fists more than her magic. There's a reason for that. Most Maidens conjure weapons from their P-Magic—greatswords, spears, you name it. It's the norm.

She gestures with a large hand, as if weighing an invisible force.

**TYRAN REX:**
Taurus was not so fortunate. She was born with a significantly smaller P-Magic pool than average. Conjuring and sustaining a weapon is a massive drain for her. For a Carni, that's practically a death sentence in the ring. So, she struggles to keep up.

Tyran lets out a short, sharp laugh, a sound of genuine respect.

**TYRAN REX:**
She's a rebel trying to win a power-lifter's competition. It's an insane, borderline impossible goal. And that's precisely why I haven't crushed her for her insolence. Anyone with that much drive is worth watching.

Tyran stands, her large frame seeming to fill the room.

**TYRAN REX:**
But that's enough gossip for one morning. The Headmaster is waiting for you in the Academic Spire. I'll show you the way.

As the Lecturer follows Tyran out of the room, their mind is no longer on the onboarding session. It's on the girl who just fled the room.

**LECTURER (V.O. / Internal Monologue):**
Struggling to keep up... That's what President Rex said. She fights that way not just out of choice, but out of necessity. She's turned a critical weakness into a unique, terrifying strength. An entire fighting style born from a disadvantage.

**LECTURER (V.O. / Internal Monologue):**
A champion isn't just someone with overwhelming talent. It's someone who can adapt, innovate, and defy their own limits. Sastrei Taurus isn't just an outlier... she's a revolution waiting to happen. I think I've found my champion.
