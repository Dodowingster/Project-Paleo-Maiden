# Chapter 2: The Spark of a Revolution

**[SCENE START]**

**LOCATION:** Stratum Institute - Training Gymnasium

**BACKGROUND:** The vast gym echoes with the sounds of sparring. Maidens clash across several training rings. The LECTURER stands on an observation deck, clipboard in hand, fulfilling their official duties. Their attention is drawn to one particular ring where SASTREI TAURUS and CAZA AMARGA are facing off.

Amarga stands poised, her P-Magic-conjured Mangual held ready—a formidable flail with a spiked head and impressive reach. Across from her, Sastrei is in her boxer's stance, her hands glowing faintly. She grits her teeth, trying to focus her P-Magic. A pair of small, shimmering gauntlets flicker into existence over her fists, but they look unstable, almost translucent.

The spar begins. Sastrei darts forward, but Amarga easily keeps her at a distance with the long reach of her Mangual. Every time Sastrei tries to close in, a flick of Amarga's wrist sends the spiked head of the flail cracking near her, forcing her back. The fight is frustratingly one-sided. Finally, seeing an opening, Sastrei lunges, but Amarga swings her weapon in a wide, defensive arc. The Mangual connects, and Sastrei's P-Magic reserves shatter. She stumbles back, defeated, the faint light of her gauntlets extinguishing completely.

**CAZA AMARGA:**
(Immediately dispelling her weapon and rushing over)
Good spar, Sastrei! You almost had me on that last rush! Your timing is getting better!

**SASTREI TAURUS:**
(Scowling, brushing herself off)
Hmph. Whatever. Your reach is just cheap.

The Lecturer walks down from the observation deck as the two friends exit the ring.

**LECTURER:**
That was an interesting match. You two seem quite close.

Sastrei glances at the Lecturer, then away, pulling her hood down.

**SASTREI TAURUS:**
She's just annoying is all. Follows me around like a lost puppy. We grew up together, so I'm stuck with her.

Amarga just laughs, a warm, knowing sound.

**CAZA AMARGA:**
Someone has to make sure you don't get into too much trouble! Anyway, I'm heading to the library. See you later, Sastrei! And you too, Lecturer!

**LOCATION:** Stratum Institute - Running Field - Late Afternoon

**BACKGROUND:** The sun is beginning to set, casting long shadows across the state-of-the-art running track that circles the upper deck of the Institute. The LECTURER is there, reviewing student performance data. They spot a lone figure on the track, running lap after lap with a relentless, punishing pace. It's Sastrei.

**LECTURER (V.O. / Internal Monologue):**
The running field... a common training spot for Maidens looking to increase their stamina, their total P-Magic pool. After that loss, it's no surprise she's here. She's trying to overcome her weakness the traditional way.

The Lecturer watches her for a moment, then a thought strikes them. They pull out their phone and open a stopwatch app. They time her next lap. Then the one after that. Their eyes widen.

**LECTURER (V.O. / Internal Monologue):**
This speed... it's not just fast. It's world-class. She's not just running; she's practically flying. She's focusing on her weakness, but she's completely blind to her greatest strength.

**LOCATION:** Stratum Institute - Running Field - Moments Later

**BACKGROUND:** Sastrei finishes a lap, panting heavily, and is about to start another when the Lecturer steps onto the track, blocking her path.

**SASTREI TAURUS:**
(Startled, then annoyed)
Lecturer? What do you want? I'm busy.

**LECTURER:**
I have a question for you. Taurus... to you, what is your strength?

Sastrei looks at them, confused by the question. She raises her bruised fists slightly.

**SASTREI TAURUS:**
I'm from the Carni dormitory. Isn't it obvious? It's my fists.

**LECTURER:**
Your fists are strong, yes. I saw that in the alley. But they aren't your ace. Your real weapon... is your footwork. Your speed.

Sastrei stares, speechless. The Lecturer presses on, their voice filled with conviction.

**LECTURER:**
You're trying to overcome your small P-Magic pool by forcing it to do something it can't: sustain a conjured weapon against someone like Amarga. You will always be at a disadvantage that way. So, I propose a new path. Abandon the conjured weapon method entirely. Stop trying to fight like everyone else.

The Lecturer takes a step closer, their eyes locked on hers.

**LECTURER:**
Instead, I want you to focus that limited P-Magic you have. Stop trying to pour it into an external weapon; it's a leaking bucket. I want you to pour it inward. Channel it into what you already possess. Enhance your legs for speed beyond any limit. Reinforce your fists until they hit like meteors. Your body is the weapon. Your speed is the delivery system, and your fists are the warhead.

Sastrei is frozen in place, her breath still ragged from her run. She stares at the Lecturer, her usual guarded expression completely gone, replaced by a raw, stunned silence. The words hang in the air, echoing what she's been told her whole life: that she's lacking, that she's deficient. But the Lecturer's proposal twists that narrative into something else entirely.

She looks down at her own bruised fists, then glances at her legs. For years, she's been running, pushing her body to its absolute limit out of sheer desperation. She always saw it as a way to compensate for her weakness. She never considered it could be her strength.

**SASTREI TAURUS:**
(Voice quiet, almost a whisper)
...Abandon it? But... that's how Paleo Arts work. You conjure a weapon. That's the rule.

**LECTURER:**
Rules are for people who need them. You have the potential to write your own.

Sastrei's gaze snaps back up to meet the Lecturer's, a fire igniting in her eyes. It's a mix of suspicion, desperation, and for the first time, a flicker of genuine hope.

**SASTREI TAURUS:**
(Her voice is stronger now, challenging)
...And you think you can teach me how? Why? What's in it for you?

The Lecturer can't help but smile at her sharp, suspicious question. It's exactly the response they expected.

**LECTURER:**
What's in it for me? Simple. Before I became a lecturer on Paleo Arts, I was a fan of human sports. Specifically, boxing. My favorite athlete was a fighter they called "The Hitman"—a master of technique, speed, and devastating combinations.

The Lecturer's eyes gleam with excitement.

**LECTURER:**
When I saw you fight in that alley, and just now on this track... I didn't just see a Maiden struggling with her P-Magic. I saw the ghost of his style. The footwork, the explosive speed, the raw potential. So, to answer your question... I want to see something new. Something revolutionary.

**LECTURER:**
I want you to learn how to box. I want to help you become the first Paleo Maiden to ever step into the ring as a true boxer.

The words hang in the cool evening air. "The first."

Sastrei is completely still. Her sharp, challenging demeanor evaporates, leaving behind a raw, unguarded expression of pure shock. All her life, she has been defined by what she lacks. She has been fighting a losing battle, trying to force her limited P-Magic into a mold that was never meant for her.

And now, this lecturer isn't offering pity or telling her to just "try harder." They are offering a new mold. A solution. A path where her greatest weakness—her inability to sustain a conjured weapon—is rendered completely irrelevant. A path where everything she has built out of sheer, desperate necessity—her speed, her footwork, her physical grit—is not a compensation, but the very foundation of a new power.

She looks from the Lecturer's earnest face down to her own bruised hands, then back again. The fire in her eyes is no longer one of defiance, but of dawning, brilliant hope. This is the answer she never knew she was looking for.

**SASTREI TAURUS:**
(Her voice is quiet, stripped of all its usual cynicism, and filled with a fragile awe)
...You can do that? You can teach me... to be a weapon?

The Lecturer shakes their head, a small, encouraging smile on their face.

**LECTURER:**
I can't teach you to be a weapon... no. But I can teach you to be a champion.
