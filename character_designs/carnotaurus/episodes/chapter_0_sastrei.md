# Chapter 0: The Rogue of the Back-Alleys

**[SCENE START]**

**LOCATION:** A labyrinthine network of city streets - Evening

**BACKGROUND:** The sky is a bruised purple, and the neon signs of downtown cast long, distorted shadows. The air is thick with the smell of rain-slicked asphalt and street food. The player, the new LECTURER, looks down at a map on their phone, then back up at the identical-looking street corners, completely lost.

**LECTURER (Player):**
(Muttering to themself)
The directions to the Stratum Institute's mainland port seemed so straightforward on the website. "A ten-minute walk from the central station." I've been walking for forty...

A tall, gentle-looking young woman with a remarkably twin drill hair approaches, her expression warm and concerned. This is CAZA AMARGA.

**CAZA AMARGA:**
Excuse me, you look a little lost. Are you trying to find your way somewhere?

**LECTURER:**
Oh! Yes, thank you. I'm looking for the port where the Stratum Institute is docked. I'm... a new lecturer.

Amarga's eyes light up with recognition and a hint of pride.

**CAZA AMARGA:**
A new lecturer! Welcome! I'm a student there. Caza Amarga. It's an honor to meet you. The port is this way, I can show you! I know this area like the back of my hand.

**LOCATION:** A dark, narrow back-alley - Moments later

**BACKGROUND:** The cheerful city sounds have been replaced by the drip of water from rusty pipes and the distant hum of ventilation fans. Graffiti covers the brick walls. It's clear Amarga's confidence was misplaced.

**CAZA AMARGA:**
(Nervously chuckling)
Ah... well, it seems they've changed the layout a bit since I was last here. I'm so sorry, Lecturer. I think this might be a... shortcut?

Before the Lecturer can respond, three rough-looking HOOLIGANS step out from the shadows, blocking the alley's exit. The leader smirks, his eyes lingering on Amarga.

**HOOLIGAN LEADER:**
Well, well. Look what we've got here. A Paleo Maiden and her friend, taking a little stroll through our neighborhood. You know the rules, Maiden. No P-Magic on us regular folk. Makes things a whole lot simpler.

Amarga instinctively takes a protective step in front of the Lecturer, her posture becoming defensive. Her hands clench, but she makes no move to summon her weapon. She knows he's right.

**CAZA AMARGA:**
We don't want any trouble. Please, just let us pass.

**HOOLIGAN LEADER:**
(Laughs)
We'll let you pass. Just need a little... "toll fee." Wallets, phones. Everything. Now.

As the hooligans advance, a new voice cuts through the tension—cool, sharp, and laced with disdain.

**VOICE:**
Hmph. Pathetic. Picking on people who can't fight back.

SASTREI TAURUS emerges from the other end of the alley, hood pulled low over her eyes. She cracks her knuckles, the sound echoing off the walls. She glances at Amarga, then at the hooligans, her expression one of utter boredom.

**CAZA AMARGA:**
Taurus!

**SASTREI TAURUS:**
(Ignoring Amarga, addressing the Hooligan Leader)
The punk's right. It's against the rules to use P-Magic to conjure a weapon and hit a human.

Her fists raised. A smirk plays on her lips.

**SASTREI TAURUS:**
...but it's fine if I don't use any magic at all, right?

Before the hooligans can react, she explodes into motion. She weaves past the first one's clumsy swing, delivering three lightning-fast jabs to his ribs. She ducks under a punch from the second, driving a powerful body blow that doubles him over.

The Hooligan Leader, panicked, fumbles inside his jacket and pulls out a handgun, aiming it at her.

**LECTURER:**
A gun! Look out!

*BANG!* The gunshot is deafening in the enclosed space. But Taurus is already moving. Instead of backing away, she ducks *forward*, the bullet whistling harmlessly over her head. The single motion closes the distance instantly. With all her momentum, she drives a devastating uppercut into the leader's jaw. He crumples to the ground, unconscious before he hits the pavement.

Silence. Taurus stands over the defeated thugs, shaking out her hand as if annoyed she had to exert herself. The Lecturer stares, completely stunned. They've read countless papers on Paleo Arts, on the disciplines of Power, Focus, and Control. They've never seen anything like this—no conjured weapons, no shimmering shields, just pure, terrifyingly precise physical combat. This wasn't P-Magic. This was something else entirely.

**LOCATION:** Stratum Institute - Main Docking Port

**BACKGROUND:** The trio finally arrives at the brightly lit, immense docking port of the Stratum Institute. The sheer scale of the vessel is breathtaking. A powerfully built figure stands waiting for them, arms crossed. It's TYRAN REX.

**CAZA AMARGA:**
(Bowing slightly)
President Rex! My deepest apologies for the delay. It was entirely my fault, I'm afraid I led the new Lecturer astray...

**TYRAN REX:**
(Waving a hand dismissively, her voice booming)
Details! What matters is that you're here. Lecturer, I was beginning to worry. Welcome to the Stratum Institute.

Taurus gives a curt nod towards Tyran and starts to walk away toward the Carni Sector entrance.

**SASTREI TAURUS:**
I'm heading back to the Warren. See ya, Amarga.

**CAZA AMARGA:**
Ah, right! Good night, Taurus! And welcome again, Lecturer. Please rest well!

Amarga gives a final, warm smile before heading in the opposite direction, toward the Herbi Sector. Tyran turns her full attention to the Lecturer.

**TYRAN REX:**
It's late. Your official onboarding can wait until morning. For now, let's get you to your quarters. You must be exhausted.

As she speaks, her eyes follow Taurus's retreating form. She catches a glimpse of Taurus's hand as it swings by her side—the knuckles are red and bruised. Tyran's expression hardens for a split second, a flicker of her "Apex of the Underworld" past showing through. She opens her mouth as if to shout something.

**TYRAN REX:**
Taurus, your han—

She cuts herself off, sighing. She shakes her head, her expression softening back to her usual demeanor.

**TYRAN REX:**
(Muttering to herself)
...No. She must be tired. We'll talk later.

**LOCATION:** Lecturer's Quarters - Night

**BACKGROUND:** The room is spacious and modern, with a large porthole window offering a stunning view of the dark, moonlit ocean. The gentle hum of the Institute's engines is a low, constant presence. The LECTURER stands by the window, lost in thought.

**LECTURER (V.O. / Internal Monologue):**
What a first day... I expected to be overwhelmed by the scale of the Stratum Institute, not by a back-alley brawl.

*(A brief, silent flashback shows Taurus ducking the bullet and delivering the final uppercut.)*

**LECTURER (V.O. / Internal Monologue):**
That girl... Sastrei Taurus. Everything I've studied, every paper I've read on Paleo Arts, centers on the disciplines of Power, Focus, Flow, and Control. It's all about channeling P-Magic. But she... she didn't use any. It was pure, kinetic violence. Precise, brutal, and terrifyingly effective.

*(The Lecturer turns from the window, a thoughtful expression on their face.)*

**LECTURER (V.O. / Internal Monologue):**
The Apex League is for Power and Focus. The Bulwark for Flow and Control. A Carnotaurus should be a natural fit for the Apex League's philosophy of overwhelming force. And yet... she fought with a speed and precision that defies that expectation, all without any visible P-Magic. How fascinating.

*(A small, determined smile forms on the Lecturer's face.)*

**LECTURER (V.O. / Internal Monologue):**
Sastrei Taurus... she has the potential to shatter every expectation. I should get some sleep. Tomorrow, my real work begins.
