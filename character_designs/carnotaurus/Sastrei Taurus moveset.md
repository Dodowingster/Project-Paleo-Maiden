# Sastrei Taurus - Fighting Game Moveset

## System Mechanics

**Meter Gain**
*   **Archetype Modifier:** **Slow.** Sastrei builds meter slower than average to compensate for her high mobility and mix-up potential. She relies on technical execution rather than raw resource expenditure.

**Endurance Gauge**
*   **Description:** A secondary bar that determines Sastrei's defense. High Endurance = Reduced damage taken.
*   **Spend:** Landing a **Fully Charged D-Normal** (True Unblockable) consumes Endurance.
*   **Restore:** **Dash Canceling** a D-Normal during the charge restores Endurance.

**Vocation Shift**
*   **Input:** `22A` (Kinetic Boxer), `22B` (Boxing Magus), `22C` (Calculated Brawler). **(Air OK)**
*   **Neutral Shift:** **Meterless.** Sastrei poses briefly to switch styles. Vulnerable during the switch.
*   **Cancel Shift:** **50% Meter.** Cancels the recovery of the current action to switch Vocations. Functions like a Rapid Cancel.
*   **Tech: Jump Install (Meterless Shift)**
    *   **Input:** `8` (Jump) + `22X` (Shift) during a Jump-Cancellable move.
    *   **Mechanic:** By canceling the **Jump Squat** frames into a Vocation Shift, the meter cost is **bypassed**.
    *   **Strategy:** Since most of Sastrei's kit is jump-cancellable, her gameplan revolves around this high-execution tech to shift for free, preserving her slow-building meter for Supers.

## General Normals (Shared)

| Input | Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5A** | Jab | A chainable jab with very short range. Very fast. |
| **5AA** | Scoop Hook | Scoops the opponent in. Puts them in a better position to tick throw or continue with 5C pressure. |
| **5B** | Lunge Punch | A long-range straight lunging punch. Her best ranged normal. |
| **5C** | Step-in Gut Punch | Faster than 5B but slower than 5A. Lunges forward slightly, putting weight into a low-aimed, horizontal punch. |
| **2A** | Flicker Jab (Mid) | A flicker jab that is not a low, pretty far ranged for a light button and is chainable. Slower than 5A but faster than B or C normals. |
| **2B** | Low Flicker | A flicker jab aimed at the feet. Hits low. |
| **2C** | Crouch Swing | Low-profile crouch into a massive, high-arching semi-circle swing above her head. Her most reliable anti-air. Leads to high damage combos. |
| **3C** | Sweep | A low sweep with a sweeping punch aiming at the feet. |

## Vocation 1: Kinetic Boxer (Rushdown / Naoto Style)
**Archetype:** High Speed / Dash Cancels / Execution Heavy

**Unique Mechanics:**

    *   **Hit:** The weapon dissolves into nothing immediately upon contact.
    *   **Full Charge:** The weapon shatters on impact, becoming **True Unblockable**, but the exertion consumes a portion of her **Endurance Gauge**.
    *   **Feint:** Dash Canceling (`66`/`44`) during the charge generates a **Kinetic Pulse**.
