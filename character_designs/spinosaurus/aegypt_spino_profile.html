            <!-- TODO: Write the character's background and personality here. -->
            <p>
                Aegypt Spino is the Head of the <strong>Stratum Institute's Fishing Club</strong> and a prominent member
                of the
                <strong>Apex League (Carni Dorm)</strong>. Outwardly, she is prideful and confident, presenting herself
                as a jack of
                all trades who has an answer for every situation. This persona, however, is a carefully constructed
                shield. Internally, Spino suffers from a profound <strong>identity crisis</strong>.

                Spino feels she lacks a core specialty. Unlike Tyran's pure power or Sastrei's pure speed, her abilities
                are multifaceted and adaptable, leaving her feeling like a "jack-of-all-trades, master of none."

                            Spino views Tyran with a complex mix of disdain and envy. She scoffs at Tyran's brutish,
                            one-dimensional power, yet secretly envies her absolute certainty of self. To Spino, Tyran
                            represents everything she lacks: a clear, undisputed identity. Their rivalry is Brains vs.
                            Brawn, but also a clash between crippling self-doubt and supreme self-confidence.

                <li>
                    Her birthdate, December 19th, is a reference to the year (1912) that paleontologist Ernst Stromer
                    began his famed Egyptian expedition where the first
                    <em>
                        Spinosaurus
                    </em>
                    fossils were discovered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Her rivalry with Tyran Rex is a direct homage to the famous "Spinosaurus vs. T-Rex" debate among
                    paleontological fans. Her fighting style, which focuses on neutralizing a single, powerful opponent,
                    is tailor-made to counter Tyran.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Her passion for fishing is a direct reflection of her species' real-world status as a piscivore
                    (fish-eater). Her use of a palm axe, however, is a nod to her Egyptian heritage, taking inspiration
                    from the hooked shape of ancient weapons like the Khopesh.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Her internal identity crisis is a direct parallel to the real-world scientific debate over
                    <em>
                        Spinosaurus
                    </em>
                    's lifestyle, which has shifted from terrestrial, to quadrupedal, to semi-aquatic over the decades.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Her titles "The River Dragon" and "Apex Tactician" have been removed from the profile to better
                    reflect her internal struggle and make her less defined.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Her profound hatred of war movies is a reference to the historical fact that the original, most
                    complete
                    <em>
                        Spinosaurus
                    </em>
                    fossils were destroyed during a World War II bombing raid on Munich in 1944. This event fuels her
                    character's feeling that her identity was stolen by the senselessness of war.
