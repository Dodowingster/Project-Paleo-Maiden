                            or aquatic?), making her a perpetual outsider seeking a crew.

            <!-- TODO: Write the character's background and personality here. -->
            <p>
                Aegypt Spino is a flamboyant and boisterous <b>transfer student</b> who immediately declared herself the
                "Captain" of the Stratum Institute's waterways. Dressed in modified pirate regalia, she presents herself
                as a worldly adventurer who has sailed the most dangerous seas of the Primeval Continents. She is
                obsessed with <b>fame and popularity</b>, constantly regaling anyone who will listen (and many who
                won't)
                with exaggerated tales of her exploits to build her legend.
                <br><br>
                However, this loud persona masks a deep-seated <b>anxiety of authenticity</b>. She has embellished and
                rewritten her own backstory so many times to please others that she has lost track of what is true. She
                fears her entire identity is a house of cards that could collapse if anyone looks too closely, leaving
                her unsure if she is the legendary captain she claims to be, or just a fraud.

                            Spino views Tyran as the ultimate symbol of the "establishment"—popular, defined, and
                            accepted. She challenges Tyran not just to win, but to disrupt the status quo. Tyran finds
                            Spino's pirate antics annoying, while Spino is desperate to prove that a "freak" like her
                            can outshine the Queen of Dinosaurs.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Her birthdate, December 19th, is a reference to the year (1912) that paleontologist Ernst Stromer
                    began his famed Egyptian expedition where the first
                    <em>
                        Spinosaurus
                    </em>
                    fossils were discovered.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Her habit of constantly rewriting her own backstory is a meta-commentary on the
                    <strong>
                        "Spinosaurus Identity Crisis"
                    </strong>
                    in paleontology. Just as scientists have drastically rewritten the Spinosaurus's description over
                    decades (bipedal vs. quadrupedal vs. aquatic), Spino constantly edits her own life story, leading to
                    her confusion about what is "canon."
                </li>
                <li>
                    Her "adventure stories" are often 50% truth and 50% fabrication, reflecting the fragmentary nature
                    of Spinosaurus fossils.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Her profound hatred of war movies is a reference to the historical fact that the original, most
                    complete
                    <em>
                        Spinosaurus
                    </em>
                    fossils were destroyed during a World War II bombing raid on Munich in 1944. This event fuels her
                    fear of being "erased" from history.
